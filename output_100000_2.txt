<title>Anarchism</title>
<wiki-abstract> Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy. Anarchism calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post-classical currents (anarcha-feminism, green anarchism and post-anarchism) developed thereafter.Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.Robert Paul Wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate while A. John Simmons and Leslie Green, who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others.Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin (1756xe2x80x931836) and Wilhelm Weitling (1808xe2x80x931871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs.The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist () was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809xe2x80x931865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century.In contrast with the big-A anarchism of the classical era, the newly coined term small-a anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to justify their opinions. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.Of the five PDD forms, Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called atypical autism) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.b'      DESCRIPTION: Neurodevelopmental disorder involving social communication difficulties and repetitive behavior. { }Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior.Autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors.Globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people .Autism is a highly variable, neurodevelopmental disorder and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders.Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. </my-abstract>

<title>Albedo</title>
<wiki-abstract> Albedo () (, meaning 'whiteness') is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle, including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces.The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, absolute magnitude and diameter is:The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the Sahara Desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below xe2x88x9240& xc2xb0C.For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle xcexb8 can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:with <math>{1-D}</math> being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and <math>{D}</math> being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo <math>{alpha}</math> (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.The albedos of planets, satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type.In the English grammar, "a", and its variant "an", are indefinite articles.The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is aleph (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet, influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Also, the Barber Motorsports Park has hosted IndyCar Series and Rolex Sports Car Series races.The ATP Birmingham was a World Championship Tennis tournament held from 1973 to 1980.Alabama has hosted several professional golf tournaments, such as the 1984 and 1990 PGA Championship at Shoal Creek, the Barbasol Championship (PGA Tour), the Mobile LPGA Tournament of Champions, Airbus LPGA Classic, and Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic (LPGA Tour), and The Tradition (Champions Tour).Major airports with sustained operations in Alabama include Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport (BHM), Huntsville International Airport (HSV), Dothan Regional Airport (DHN), Mobile Regional Airport (MOB), Montgomery Regional Airport (MGM), Northwest Alabama Regional Airport (MSL) and Northeast Alabama Regional Airport (GAD).For rail transport, Amtrak schedules the Crescent, a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa.Alabama has six major interstate routes: Interstate 65 (I-65) travels northxe2x80x93south roughly through the middle of the state; I-20/I-59 travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards Atlanta; I-85 originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and I-10 traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile.In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) (University of Alabama School of Medicine, University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicinexe2x80x94Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (Auburn University and Tuskegee University), a dental school (University of Alabama School of Dentistry), an optometry college (University of Alabama at Birmingham), two pharmacy schools (Auburn University and Samford University), and five law schools (University of Alabama School of Law, Birmingham School of Law, Cumberland School of Law, Miles Law School, and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law).Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.Accreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE),According to the 2011 U.S. News & World Report, Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (University of Alabama at 31, Auburn University at 36, and University of Alabama at Birmingham at 73).Major newspapers include Birmingham News, Mobile Press-Register, and Montgomery Advertiser.College football is extremely popular in Alabama, particularly the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn University Tigers, rivals in the Southeastern Conference.The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were undocumented (24,000).The center of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County, outside the town of Jemison.Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported.In 1984, under the Davisxe2x80x93Strong Act, the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission.The Presbyterian churches, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (PCAxe2x80x9428,009 members in 108 congregations, PC(USA)xe2x80x9426,247 members in 147 congregations,Although in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, the Bahxc3xa1xcaxbcxc3xad Faith, and Unitarian Universalism.Jews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London.Muslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts.The first community of adherents of the Bahxc3xa1xcaxbcxc3xad Faith in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K. Dealy, who moved from Chicago to Fairhope.The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas."The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution.Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.In the U.S. House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (Bradley Byrne, Mike D. Rogers, Robert Aderholt, Morris J. Brooks, Martha Roby, and Gary Palmer) and one Democrat: Terri Sewell who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery.Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Lincoln is remembered as the martyr hero of the United States and he is consistently ranked as one of the greatest presidents in American history.Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, in a one-room log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky.Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties.As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party.)</small>|alt=Painting of four men conferring in a ship's cabin, entitled "The Peacemakers".poly 486 710 579 672 663 739 687 863 649 936 579 965 739 1133 782 1037 800 956 910 905 905 1025 855 1305 576 1223 513 1371 620 1388 687 1467 846 1510 1010 2035 1160 2140 869 2135 718 1682 663 1685 634 2000 725 2030 489 2095 504 1800 362 1775 263 1710 225 1516 252 1226 269 1046 324 948 434 913 481 866 446 782 General Shermanpoly 1092 794 1182 823 1188 892 1162 970 1220 1023 1330 1179 1429 1153 1478 1223 1388 1498 1440 1548 1397 1568 1397 1788 1429 1826 1385 1867 1301 1838 1275 1571 1243 1533 1243 1478 1095 1492 985 1588 924 1133 970 1028 1046 991 1028 907 1034 837 General Grantpoly 1634 802 1715 770 1794 825 1800 950 1933 962 2194 1072 2188 1185 2116 1347 2029 1396 2032 1547 1669 1544 1740 1947 1527 1945 1579 1875 1620 1852 1599 1730 1565 1883 1394 1930 1408 1872 1454 1817 1559 1333 1568 1260 1599 1182 1672 980 1620 886 President Lincolnpoly 2620 780 2740 775 2754 889 2745 991 2855 1064 2864 1316 2800 1420 2766 1516 2806 1600 2772 1942 2664 1919 2577 1791 2508 1780 2496 1719 2455 1745 2496 2052 2348 2145 2308 2128 2345 2038 2293 1759 2229 2081 1977 2076 1997 2035 2058 2009 2093 1965 2174 1537 2461 1429 2453 1290 2357 1382 2287 1336 2290 1287 2354 1203 2412 1179 2499 1133 2540 1072 2560 988 2595 837 Admiral PorterGrant's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln.Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the King James Bible, Aesop's Fables, John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.As a teen, Lincoln took responsibility for chores, and customarily gave his father all earnings from work outside the home until he was 21.Lincoln rejected Fremont's two emancipation attempts in August 1861, as well as one by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and would upset loyal border states.In June 1862, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory, which Lincoln signed.Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.After the Union rout at Bull Run and Winfield Scott's retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief.To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals' choice, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment.In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy.On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union, in which he argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. </my-abstract>

AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the Organon made by Boethius."File:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg | Nuremberg Chronicle anachronistically shows Aristotle in a medieval scholar's clothing. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This became the standard performing edition until 2000, when Gershwin specialist Jack Gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of An American in Paris, working directly from Gershwin's original manuscript, including the restoration of Gershwin's soprano saxophone parts removed in Campbell-Watson's revision; Gibbons' restored orchestration of An American in Paris was performed at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall on July 9, 2000 by the City of Oxford Orchestra conducted by Levon Parikian.The score to An American in Paris was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released.To this end, upon his return to New York, Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel's friend Robert Schmitz, a pianist Ravel had met during the war, to urge Ravel to tour the U.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica, promoting Franco-American musical relations, and was able to offer Ravel a $10,000 fee for the tour, an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel.Gershwin greeted Ravel in New York in March 1928 during a party held for Ravel's birthday by xc3x89va Gauthier.Gershwin based An American in Paris on a melodic fragment called "Very Parisienne",He described the piece as a "rhapsodic ballet" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. </my-abstract>

'Later, evidence arose suggesting that Opel's appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show's producer Jack Haley Jr. Robert Metzler, the show's business manager, believed that the incident had been planned in some way; during the dress rehearsal Niven had asked Metzler's wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line, which was thus not the ad-lib it appeared to be.The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.Since 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the Academy Award for Best Picture.Traditionally, the previous year's winner for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor present the awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, while the previous year's winner for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress present the awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor.Parasite became the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture at the February 9, 2020 award ceremony.Tom Hanks announced at the 2020 Oscar Ceremony, the opening of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures on December 14, 2020.This has led, at times, to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity, to make up for a "snub" for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one actually awarded, or presented as a "career honor" to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.Following the 91st Academy Awards in February 2019 in which the Netflix-broadcast film Roma had been nominated for ten awards including the Best Picture category, Steven Spielberg and other members of the Academy discussed changing the requirements through the Board of Governors for films as to exclude those from Netflix and other media streaming services.The industry curated exhibits will be geared toward the history of motion picture, the art & science of film making, exhibiting trailblazing directors, actors, film makers, sound editors and more, and will house famous artifacts from acclaimed movies like Dorothy's Ruby Red Slippers.Because of COVID-19, Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson announced that for the 2021 Oscar Ceremony, streaming movies not shown in theaters would be eligible, though at some point the requirement that movies be shown in theaters would return.The best known award is the Academy Award of Merit, more popularly known as the Oscar statuette.The Academy officially adopted the name "Oscar" for the trophies in 1939.)The Academy Awards is the world's longest-running awards show televised live from the U.S. to all time zones in North America and worldwide, and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.Originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, the 40th Academy Awards ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. On March 30, 1981, the 53rd Academy Awards was postponed for one day, after the shooting of President Ronald Reagan and others in Washington, D.C.At the 45th Academy Awards ceremony, Brando sent actress and civil rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather to read a 15-page speech, detailing his criticisms, which was booed by the audience.At the 89th Academy Awards ceremony, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly announced La La Land as the recipient of the Best Picture award, instead of Moonlight, the actual winner.The 21st Academy Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what had been the Academy's headquarters on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood.In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two categories (Drama and Comedy)..In December 2011, Orson Welles' 1941 Oscar for Citizen Kane (Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.The Academy also awards Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting.Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in mid-January. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He attributes the attention she receives to her being a "compelling writer", especially as a novelist, noting that Atlas Shrugged outsells Rand's non-fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, or Frederic Bastiat.Several critics claim that the 1863 novel xe2x80x9cWhat Is to Be Done?xe2x80x9dRegarding Rand's particular disdain for the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, philosophers George Walsh have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.Political scientist Charles Murray, while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only "philosophical debt" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche.In the Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that "Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation".Some scholars focus specifically on Rand's work.A satirical film by artist and scholar Zach Blas called Jubilee 2033, exhibited primarily in art galleries and museums, features a young Ayn Rand and Alan Greenspan traveling through time to visit a dystopian Silicon Valley, whose success and ruin is attributed to Rand's technologist followers such as Peter Thiel.Although she rejected the labels "conservative" and "libertarian",The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the Republican Party),The financial crisis of 2007xe2x80x932008 spurred renewed interest in her works, especially Atlas Shrugged, which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis.During Rand's lifetime, her work received little attention from academic scholars.Since Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased.Writing in the 1998 edition of the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, political theorist Chandran Kukathas summarizes the mainstream philosophical reception to her work in two parts.After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, however, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,By this time, she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand,}}In late 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago.In Hollywood, a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B. DeMille led to work as an extra in his film The King of Kings and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter.Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932, although it was never produced.Rand's first published novel, the semi-autobiographical We the Living, was published in 1936.In 1987 Allan Gotthelf, George Walsh and David Kelley co-founded the Ayn Rand Society, a group affiliated with the American Philosophical Association.In 2012, the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an "Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies" series based on the proceedings of the Society.Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen, while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as "literary, hyperbolic and emotional".In 1985, Rand's intellectual heir, Leonard Peikoff, established the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> After an earlier period during which the Algerian government tried to phase out French, in recent decades the government has backtracked and reinforced the study of French, and some television programs are broadcast in the language.Algeria emerged as a bilingual state after 1962.}}Islam is the predominant religion in Algeria, with its adherents, mostly Sunnis, accounting for 99% of the population according to a 2012 CIA World Factbook estimate,Algeria has given the Muslim world a number of prominent thinkers, including Emir Abdelkader, Abdelhamid Ben Badis, Mouloud Kacem Naxc3xaet Belkacem, Malek Bennabi and Mohamed Arkoun.Below is a list of the most important Algerian cities:Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic, Tamazight and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history.Algerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first step and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation.Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the Western Sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the Arab Maghreb Union, nominally established in 1989, but which has carried little practical weight.The military of Algeria consists of the People's National Army (ANP), the Algerian National Navy (MRA), and the Algerian Air Force (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defence Forces.In 1957 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature.Today Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the Algerian trilogy of Mohammed Dib, or even Nedjma of Kateb Yacine novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work.Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include Mouloud Feraoun, Malek Bennabi, Malek Haddad, Moufdi Zakaria, Abdelhamid Ben Badis, Mohamed Laxc3xafd Al-Khalifa, Mouloud Mammeri, Frantz Fanon, and Assia Djebar.In the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are Rachid Boudjedra, Rachid Mimouni, Leila Sebbar, Tahar Djaout and Tahir Wattar.Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure.Rap, a relatively recent style in Algeria, is experiencing significant growth.The Algerian state's interest in film-industry activities can be seen in the annual budget of DZD 200 million (EUR 1.8) allocated to production, specific measures and an ambitious programme plan implemented by the Ministry of Culture in order to promote national production, renovate the cinema stock and remedy the weak links in distribution and exploitation.The financial support provided by the state, through the Fund for the Development of the Arts, Techniques and the Film Industry (FDATIC) and the Algerian Agency for Cultural Influence (AARC), plays a key role in the promotion of national production.The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.The Barbary pirates preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea.Barbary raids in the Mediterranean continued to attack Spanish merchant shipping, and as a result, the Spanish Navy bombarded Algiers in 1783 and 1784.In the 19th century, the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a "licence tax" in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels.Despite being removed from Algeria in the 19th century, Spain retained a presence in Morocco. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method, a central part of their science.Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see History of anthropology), including but not limited to fossil-hunting, exploring, documentary film-making, paleontology, primatology, antiquity dealings and curatorship, philology, etymology, genetics, regional analysis, ethnology, history, philosophy, and religious studies,Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of "other cultures", both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-Western societies).Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's "home".In France, the study of Western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists, but this is increasingly changing, starting in the 1970s from scholars like Isac Chiva and journals like Terrain ("fieldwork"), and developing with the center founded by Marc Augxc3xa9 (Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains, the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies).Since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the North Atlantic region, frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale.The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as geology, physics, zoology, paleontology, anatomy, music theory, art history, sociology and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.As the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves, and professional societies have generated codes of ethics.Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.Some commentators have contended:As part of their quest for scientific objectivity, present-day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism, which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology.Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide, infanticide, racism, mutilation (including circumcision and subincision), and torture.Anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences, including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of Homo sapiens, human physical traits, human behavior, the variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past of Homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture, and from social sciences, including the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.Understanding Other Religions: Al-Biruni's and Gadamer's "fusion of Horizons"By Kemal Ataman page 59</ref> As such, anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, global studies, and various ethnic studies.According to Clifford Geertz,Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies.Boas' Primitive Art, Claude Lxc3xa9vi-Strauss' The Way of the Masks (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media.b'      DESCRIPTION: Scientific study of humans, human behavior and societies.Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with human behavior, human biology, and societies, in both the present and past, including  past human species.Archaeology, which studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence, is considered a branch of anthropology in the United States and Canada, while in Europe it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.The abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to history. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries, often referred to as the Green Revolution, was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and pesticides.As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture, industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. </my-abstract>

From early in its development, ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard.
International Reference Alphabet (IRA)
International Alphabet No. 5 (IA5) -->
Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as ISO 646 (1967) that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's pound sterling (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the US and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters.
Many other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. é, ñ, ß, Ł), currency symbols (e.g. £, ¥), etc. See also YUSCII (Yugoslavia).
It would share most characters in common, but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for "national use". However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.
ISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, is a 7-bit character set. It does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.
Because the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to "national use" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as
instead of
C trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ANSI C, although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or Usenet) contained "{, }" and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get "N{ jag har sm|rg}sar" as the answer, which should be "Nä jag har smörgåsar" meaning "No I've got sandwiches".
 , 
Eventually, as 8-, 16- and 32-bit (and later 64-bit) computers began to replace 12-, 18- and 36-bit computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.
Encodings include ISCII (India), VISCII (Vietnam). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.
Most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics. Kaypro CP/M computers used the "upper" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet.
The PETSCII code Commodore International used for their 8-bit systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the ZX Spectrum computer. Atari 8-bit computers and Galaksija computers also used ASCII variants.
The IBM PC defined code page 437, which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces, and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as DOS supported these code pages, and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware. Digital Equipment Corporation developed the Multinational Character Set (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular VT220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined Mac OS Roman and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.
The ISO/IEC 8859 standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, Windows-1252 (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.  ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when UTF-8 became more common.
ISO/IEC 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9F hexadecimal range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.
 , 
Unicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using natural numbers called code points) and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32).
ASCII was incorporated into the Unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows UTF-8 to be backward compatible with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly, forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.

<my-abstract> The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute (USASI) and ultimately the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).With the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, Locating the lowercase letters in sticks 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit, which simplified case-insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers.The X3 committee made other changes, including other new characters (the brace and vertical bar characters),Revisions of the ASCII standard:In the X3.15 standard, the X3 committee also addressed how ASCII should be transmitted (least significant bit first), and how it should be recorded on perforated tape.The first two so-called ASCII sticks The digits 0xe2x80x939 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining 4 bits correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward.Many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters, not electric typewriters..Some common characters were not included, notably <code>xc2xbdxc2xbcxc2xa2</code>, while <code>^`~</code> were included as diacritics for international use, and <code>&lt;&gt;</code> for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters <code>|</code> (in addition to common <code>/</code>). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It was produced in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation on the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), developed by The Walt Disney Company in collaboration with Pixar in the late 1980s.The so-called 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's Toy Story (1995), the first computer-animated feature in this style.Most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable.In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.Traditional animation (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include The Lion King (US, 1994), The Prince of Egypt (US, 1998), Akira (Japan, 1988), Spirited Away (Japan, 2001), The Triplets of Belleville (France, 2003), and The Secret of Kells (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).Full animation refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement, having a smooth animation.Up and Toy Story 3 also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.Several other countries have instituted an award for the best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation (since 2008), BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film (since 2006), Cxc3xa9sar Award for Best Animated Film (since 2011), Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation (since 1981), Goya Award for Best Animated Film (since 1989), Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year (since 2007), National Film Award for Best Animated Film (since 2006). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb  (apollymi), "to destroy".A number of non-Greek etymologies have been suggested for the name,The role of Apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of Apollo Smintheus ("mouse Apollo") by Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, with the purpose of sending a plague against the Greeks (the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is apotropaic, meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague).The Hittite testimony reflects an early form , which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot  with Doric .Apollo's chief epithet was Phoebus ( ; , Phoibos ), literally "bright".Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves, dolphins, roe deer, swans, cicadas (symbolizing music and song), ravens, hawks, crows (Apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers), snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and griffins, mythical eaglexe2x80x93lion hybrids of Eastern origin.Homer and Porphyry wrote that Apollo had a hawk as his messenger.As god of colonization, Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750xe2x80x93550 BCE.The improvement of the old Anatolian god, and his elevation to an intellectual sphere, may be considered an achievement of the Greek people.The function of Apollo as a "healer" is connected with Paean (), the physician of the gods in the Iliad, who seems to come from a more primitive religion.In the Iliad, Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the Vedic god of disease Rudra.Some common epithets of Apollo as a healer are "paion" ( literally "healer" or "helper")Homer illustrated Paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph.Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.Artemis as the sister of Apollo, is thea apollousa, that is, she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity.Finally, the voice of unborn Apollo informed his mother about a floating island named Delos which had once been Asteria, Leto's own sister.When Apollo was born, clutching a golden sword,Apollo's birth fixed the floating Delos to the earth.Homer, Hymn to Apollo</ref> Leto promised that her son would be always favorable towards the Delians.Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of hard labor once again under Admetus.The love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like Ovid and Servius.The fate of Niobe was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb.In cult practice, Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.Apollo's cult was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE.The artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.Apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a kithara (as Apollo Citharoedus) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> As early Austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways, they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area, such as Sino-Tibetan.Roger Blench (2009) also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of Austroasiatic that are now extinct, based on substrate evidence in modern-day languages.Other languages with proposed Austroasiatic substrata are:John Peterson (2017) suggests that "pre-Munda" languages may have once dominated the eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain, and were then absorbed by Indo-Aryan languages at an early date as Indo-Aryan spread east.However, the dates obtained from by Zhivotovsky method DNA studies are several times older than that given by linguists.}}}}Subsequently, Sidwell (2015a: 179) suggests that Austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake-like structure, with an eastxe2x80x93west division (consisting of Munda, Khasic, Palaungic, and Khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present.Integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings, Paul Sidwell (2015c) further expanded his Mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that Austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into Indochina from the Lingnan area of southern China, with the subsequent Mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of Neolithic farmers from southern China.Sidwell (2015c) tentatively suggests that Austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5,000 years B.P.Peterson notes that eastern Indo-Aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of Munda languages, while western Indo-Aryan languages do not.Other than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are written with the Khmer, Thai, Lao, and Burmese alphabets. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The main theories of Urheimat are the Levant/Fertile Crescent, North Africa and the Horn of Africa.Widespread (though not universal) features of the Afroasiatic languages include:One of the most remarkable shared features among the Afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation (see the table at the start of this section), with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with /xcax94 t n y/, and in particular a pattern whereby third-singular masculine /y-/ is opposed to third-singular feminine and second-singular /t-/.According to Ehret (1996), tonal languages appear in the Omotic and Chadic branches of Afroasiatic, as well as in certain Cushitic languages.In lieu of "Hamito-Semitic", the Russian linguist Igor Diakonoff later suggested the term "Afrasian", meaning "half African, half Asiatic", in reference to the geographic distribution of the family's constituent languages.The term "Hamito-Semitic" remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries, as well as in the official census of the government of India.Scholars generally treat the Afroasiatic language family as including the following branches:Although there is general agreement on these six families, linguists who study Afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement, in particular:In the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret in Algeria was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> When the Muslim Empire of Al-Andalus replaced the ruling Visigoths in most of the Iberian Peninsula, Andorra was sheltered from these invaders by the Franks.Tradition holds that Charles the Great (Charlemagne) granted a charter to the Andorran people for a contingent of five thousand soldiers under the command of Marc Almugaver, in return for fighting against the Moors near Portxc3xa9-Puymorens (Cerdanya).In 988, Borrell II, Count of Urgell, gave the Andorran valleys to the Diocese of Urgell in exchange for land in Cerdanya.The first document that mentions Andorra as a territory is the Acta de Consagracixc3xb3 i Dotacixc3xb3 de la Catedral de la Seu d'Urgell (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d'Urgell).VPC Andorra XV is a rugby team based in Andorra la Vella actually playing in the French championship.Basketball popularity has increased in the country since the 1990s, when the Andorran team BC Andorra played in the top league of Spain (Liga ACB).Andorra first participated at the Olympic Games in 1976.This body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials (veguers) appointed by France and the Bishop of Urgell.Despite not being involved in any fighting during the First World War, Andorra was technically the longest combatant, as the country was left out of the Versailles Peace Conference, technically remaining at war with Germany from its original declaration of war in 1914 until 24 September 1958 when Andorra officially declared peace with Germany.The army's role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the Police Corps of Andorra in 1931.The same company also manages the technical infrastructure for national broadcasting of digital television and radio.The first commercial radio station to broadcast was Radio Andorra, which was active from 1939 to 1981.There are three national newspapers, Diari d'Andorra, El Perixc3xb2dic d'Andorra, and Bondia as well as several local newspapers.Andorra participated regularly in the Eurovision Song Contest between 2004 and 2009, being the only participating country presenting songs in Catalan.In popular folklore, the best-known Andorran legends are the legend of Charlemagne, according to which this Frankish King would have founded the country, the White Lady of Auvinyxc3xa0, the Buner d'Ordino, the legend of Engolasters Lake and the legend of Our Lady of Meritxell.Andorran gastronomy is mainly Catalan, although it has also adopted other elements of French and Italian cuisines.The , based in the town of Santa Coloma d'Andorra, are recognized by the , the governing body of castells.File:2010 Opening Ceremony - Andorra entering.jpg|The athletes from Andorra at the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Winter OlympicsFile:Laure Soulie 3.jpg|Laure Soulixc3xa9, Olympic biathleteFile:Laurent Recouderc Serve.jpg|Laurent Recouderc serving at the 2010 French OpenFile:Irina KALENTYEVA.JPG|2015 UCI Mountain Bike and Trials World Championships in Vallnord, La MassanaFile:Cycling in Andorra.jpg|Volta als Ports d'Andorra, the national road cycling tourFile:Estadi Comunal Vella.jpg|Estadi Comunal d'Andorra la Vella}} 'On 8 July 1934 Boris issued a proclamation in Urgell, declaring himself Boris I, King of Andorra,]]During World War II, Andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between Vichy France and Francoist Spain,In the capital city there was a smuggling black market network of propaganda, culture and cinematic art not prone to totalitarian regimes, promulgated in some places as the Hotel Mirador or the Casino Hotel,The Andorran opening to the capitalist economy resulted in two axes: mass tourism and the country's tax exemption. </my-abstract>

<title>Arithmetic mean</title>
<wiki-abstract> In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean (, stress on first and third syllables of "arithmetic"), or simply the mean or the average (when the context is clear), is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection. The collection is often a set of results of an experiment or an observational study, or frequently a set of results from a survey. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> (Isaac Deutscher)]]Other connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion, which stands for the abortive revolutions in Hungary and in Germany (Ch IV); the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball (Ch V), parallelling "the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another: Trotskyism, with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the West; and Stalinism with its glorification of Russia's socialist destiny"; Napoleon's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets (Ch VI), paralleling the Treaty of Rapallo; and Frederick's forged bank notes, parallelling the Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939, after which Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill.The book's close, with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement, reflected Orwell's view of the 1943 Tehran Conference that seemed to display the establishment of "the best possible relations between the USSR and the West" xe2x80x93 but in reality were destined, as Orwell presciently predicted, to continue to unravel.In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin (""), and in his essay "Why I Write" (1946), wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole".The original title was Animal Farm: A Fairy Story, but U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it.Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker & Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the Folio Society published an edition in 1984 illustrated by Quentin Blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist Ralph Steadman was published by Secker & Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of Animal Farm.Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British self-censorship and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:Although the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included, and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.Secker and Warburg published the first edition of Animal Farm in 1945 without an introduction.Animal Farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.The CIA, from 1952 to 1957 in Operation Aedinosaur, sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down.Popular reading in schools, Animal Farm  was ranked the nation's favourite book from school in a 2016 UK poll The following are examples of this controversy that has existed around Orwell's work:An enhanced version of the book, launched in India in 2017, was widely praised for capturing the author's intent, by republishing the proposed preface of the First Edition and the preface he wrote for the Ukrainian edition. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Anchorage Daily News.Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three branches of government: an executive branch consisting of the governor of Alaska and his or her appointees which head executive departments; a legislative branch consisting of the Alaska House of Representatives and Alaska Senate; and a judicial branch consisting of the Alaska Supreme Court and lower courts.The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people statewide.The Alaska Legislature consists of a 40-member House of Representatives and a 20-member Senate.About 3.5% spoke Spanish at home, 2.2% spoke another Indo-European language, about 4.3% spoke an Asian language (including Tagalog),The Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks claims that at least 20 Alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects.A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 20 indigenous languages, known locally as "native languages".In October 2014, the governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the state's 20 indigenous languages to have official status.According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives from 2010, about 34% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations.The Anchorage Opera is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.The official state song of Alaska is "Alaska's Flag", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the flag of Alaska.Alaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was The Chechahcos, produced by Alaskan businessman Austin E. Lathrop and filmed in and around Anchorage.The University of Alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program.The Alaska State Troopers are Alaska's statewide police force.In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6& million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.Some private companies provides car float service between Whittier and Seattle.Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula.Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.Many rural communities in Alaska are considered "dry", having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages.Domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.Influences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe.Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.On March 27, 1964, the massive Good Friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides.Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is MGM's Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent, starring Alaska Native Ray Mala. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, green manure, compost and minerals.Water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.According to a report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.Payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment.Agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forest for agricultural use.Smith, P., et al., Executive summary, in: [http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter5.pdf Chapter 5: Drivers, Trends and Mitigation] (archived [https://web.archive.org/web/20141230092610/http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter5.pdf 30 December 2014)], in: Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility.These nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater, with harmful effects on human populations.Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.An alternative argument is that the way to "save the environment" and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.Animal husbandry is also responsible for greenhouse gas production of  and a percentage of the world's methane, and future land infertility, and the displacement of wildlife. </my-abstract>

<title>Analysis of variance</title>
<wiki-abstract> Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures (such as the "variation" among and between groups) used to analyze the differences among group means in a sample. ANOVA was developed by the statistician Ronald Fisher. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Data in three or more ordered groups that are defined by the researcher should be analysed by linear trend estimation.ANOVA is considered to be a special case of linear regression All consider the observations to be the sum of a model (fit) and a residual (error) to be minimized.The Kruskalxe2x80x93Wallis test and the Friedman test are nonparametric tests, which  do not rely on an assumption of normality.Below we make clear the connection between multi-way ANOVA and linear regression.Linearly re-order the data so that <math>k^text{th}</math> observation is associated with a response <math>y_k</math> and factors <math>Z_{k,b}</math> where <math>b in {1,2,ldots,B}</math> denotes the different factors and <math>B</math> is the total number of factors.Now, we can one-hot encode the factors into the <math> sum_{b=1}^B I_b</math> dimensional vector <math>v_k</math>.The one-hot encoding function <math>g_b : {1,2,ldots,I_b} mapsto {0,1}^{I_b}</math> is defined such that the <math>i^{th}</math> entry of <math>g_b(Z_{k,b})</math> isg_b(Z_{k,b})_i = begin{cases} 1 & text{if } i=Z_{k,b}  0 & text{otherwise} end{cases}The vector <math>v_k</math> is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all <math>b</math>.Therefore, by contraposition, a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the variance is constant.The use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population survey sampling.Kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of unit treatment additivity to produce a derived linear model, very similar to the textbook model discussed previously.Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.3: Completely Randomized Design; Derived Linear Model)</ref>  The test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model, according to approximation theorems and simulation studies.Kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity, which is discussed in the books of Kempthorne and David R. Cox.In its simplest form, the assumption of unit-treatment additivityThe assumption of unit-treatment additivity implies that, for every treatment <math>j</math>, the <math>j</math>th treatment has  exactly the same effect <math>t_j</math> on every experiment unit.The assumption of unit treatment additivity  usually cannot be directly falsified, according to Cox and Kempthorne.In the era of mechanical calculation it was common to subtract a constant from all observations (when equivalent to dropping leading digits) to simplify data entry.Montgomery (2001, Section 3-3: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis of variance; Analysis of the fixed effects model)</ref>Cochran & Cox (1992, p 2 example)</ref>  This is an example of datacoding.The calculations of ANOVA can be characterized as computing a numberof means and variances, dividing two variances and comparing the ratio to a handbook value to determine statistical significance.Both these analyses require homoscedasticity, as an assumption for the normal-model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization-based analysis.However, studies of processes that change variances rather than means (called dispersion effects) have been successfully conducted using ANOVA.Montgomery (2001, Section 3.8: Discovering dispersion effects)</ref>  There areo necessary assumptions for ANOVA in its full generality, but theF-test used for ANOVA hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical limitations which are of continuing interest.Problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of ANOVA can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions.From here, one can use F-statistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors.We can consider the 2-way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has 2 levels and the second factor has 3 levels.Define <math>a_i = 1</math> if <math>Z_{k,1}=i</math> and <math>b_i = 1</math> if <math>Z_{k,2}=i</math>, i.e.These include graphical methods based on limitingthe probability of false negative errors, graphical methods based on an expected variation increase (above the residuals) and methods based on achieving a desired confidence interval.Power analysis is often applied in the context of ANOVA in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain ANOVA design, effect size in the population, sample size and significance level. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Alternative names for this group are: linear paraffins or n-paraffins.The members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:; methane: CH xe2x80x93 one carbon and 4 hydrogen; ethane : C xe2x80x93 two carbon and 6 hydrogen; propane: C xe2x80x93 three carbon and 8 hydrogen; butane : C xe2x80x93 four carbon and 10 hydrogen; pentane: C xe2x80x93 five carbon and 12 hydrogen; hexane : C xe2x80x93 six carbon and 14 hydrogenThe first four names were derived from methanol, ether, propionic acid and butyric acid, respectively (hexadecane is also sometimes referred to as cetane).For a more complete list, see List of alkanes.Ball-and-stick model of [[isopentane (common name) or 2-methylbutane (IUPAC systematic name)]]Simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes, for example n-pentane, isopentane, and neopentane.IUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name.The key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows:Though technically distinct from the alkanes, this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the "cyclic alkanes."The general equation for complete combustion is:In the absence of sufficient oxygen, carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed, as shown below:For example, methane:See the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data.The standard enthalpy change of combustion, xcex94H<sup>xe2x8ax96</sup> than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.Alkanes react with halogens in a so-called free radical halogenation reaction.The odd-numbered alkanes pack less well and so the "looser" organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.Alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way, nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field.This reaction proceeds through free radical intermediate and has possibility of alkene formation in case of tertiary haloalkanes and vicinal dihalides.When haloalkane is treated with dialkyl lithium cuprite, which is otherwise known as Gilman's reagent, any higher alkane is obtained.When haloalkanes are treated with metal hydride ,eg, sodium hydride and lithium aluminium hydride.When haloalkane is treated with zinc in ester,  alkane is obtained.When aryl halide is treated with sodium in dry ether, it forms biphenyl. When aryl halide is treated with copper, it forms biphenyl.When aryl halide is treated with haloalkane, we get alkyl benzene.The applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms.In crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.Free radicals, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered, between 27 and 33 carbon atoms in lengthMore volatile short-chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The phrase is similar to the Latin phrase "" ("From sea to sea"), which is the official motto of Canada."Purple mountain majesties" refers to the shade of the Pikes Peak in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which inspired Bates to write the poem.In the 2003 Tori Amos song "Amber Waves," the "America the Beautiful" lyric "for amber waves of grain" is appropriated to create a personification; Amos imagines Amber Waves as an exotic dancer, like she by the same name, portrayed by Julianne Moore, in Boogie Nights.Lynn Sherr's 2001 book America the Beautiful discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth.America!God shed His grace on theeAnd crown thy good with brotherhoodFrom sea to shining sea!</poem>Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961).Frank Sinatra recorded the song with Nelson Riddle during the sessions for The Concert Sinatra in February 1963, for a projected 45 single release.By 1900, at least 75 different melodies had been written.At various times in the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since the song was written, particularly during the John F. Kennedy administration, there have been efforts to give "America the Beautiful" legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, "The Star-Spangled Banner", but so far this has not succeeded.Ward had originally written the music, "Materna", for the hymn "O Mother dear, Jerusalem" in 1882, though it was not first published until 1892. the wheat fields of America's heartland Kansas, through which her train was riding on July 16; and the majestic view of the Great Plains from high atop Pikes Peak.The first known melody written for the song was sent in by Silas Pratt when the poem was published in The Congregationalist.America!God shed His grace on thee,And crown thy good with brotherhoodFrom sea to shining sea.</poem>O beautiful for spacious skies,For amber waves of grain,For purple mountain majestiesAbove the fruited plain!America! </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Assistive technology may be used in adaptive sports, where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new assistive technology.In the United States there are two major pieces of legislation that govern the use of assistive technology within the school system.This equipment is frequently specialized for specific settings such as in a classroom or nursing home.xc2xa0 Positioning is often important in seating arrangements to ensure that user's body pressure is distributed equally without inhibiting movement in a desired way.Positioning devices have been developed to aid in allowing people to stand and bear weight on their legs without risk of a fall.xc2xa0 These standers are generally grouped into two categories based on the position of the occupant.xc2xa0 Prone standers distribute the body weight to the front of the individual and usually have a tray in front of them.xc2xa0 This makes them good for users who are actively trying to carry out some task.xc2xa0 Supine standers distribute the body weight to the back and are good for cases where the user has more limited mobility or is recovering from injury.xc2xa0Many people with serious visual impairments live independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques.New technologies are exploring how the visually impaired can receive visual information through wearable devices.Some wearable devices for visual impairment include:# OrCam device# eSight# BrainportPersonal emergency response systems (PERS), or Telecare (UK term), are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer.Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.One of the largest problems that affect people with disabilities is discomfort with prostheses.Assistive technology devices have been created to enable people with disabilities to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with a physical instrument.The Chinese abacus migrated from China to Korea around 1400 AD.The four beads abacus( 1:4 ) was introduced to Korea Goryeo Dynasty from the China during Song Dynasty, later the five beads abacus (5:1) abacus was introduced to Korean from China during the Ming Dynasty.Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient Aztec culture.The word Nepxc5x8dhualtzintzin  comes from Nahuatl and it is formed by the roots; Ne xe2x80x93 personal -; pxc5x8dhual or pxc5x8dhualli  xe2x80x93 the account -; and tzintzin  xe2x80x93 small similar elements.The Song Dynasty and earlier used the 1:4 type or four-beads abacus similar to the modern abacus including the shape of the beads commonly known as Japanese-style abacus.In the early Ming Dynasty, the abacus began to appear in the form of 1:5 abacus.The top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is equal to one like the Chinese or Korean abacus, and the decimal number can be expressed, so the abacus is designed as one four abacus.The 1/4 abacus, which removes the seldom used second and fifth bead became popular in the 1940s.Today's Japanese abacus is a 1:4 type, four-bead abacus was introduced from China in the Muromachi era. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth, and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.Synthetic crude oil, also known as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada.By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over  per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.In Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products: The Suncor Energy upgrader near Fort McMurray, Alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel; the Syncrude Canada, Canadian Natural Resources, and Nexen upgraders near Fort McMurray produce synthetic crude oil; and the Shell Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery.Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly, it is widely used for runways.Mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt (asphalt concrete) in that it has a higher asphalt (binder) content, usually around 7xe2x80x9310% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% asphalt.However, "asphalt" is also commonly used as a shortened form of "asphalt concrete" (therefore equivalent to the British "asphalt" or "tarmac").In Canadian English, the word "bitumen" is used to refer to the vast Canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil,"Bitumen" is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi-solid form of petroleum.By the 3rd millennium BC refined rock asphalt was in use in the region, and was used to waterproof the Great Bath in Mohenjo-daro.In the ancient Middle East, the Sumerians used natural bitumen deposits for mortar between bricks and stones, to cement parts of carvings, such as eyes, into place, for ship caulking, and for waterproofing.The  long Euphrates Tunnel beneath the river Euphrates at Babylon in the time of Queen Semiramis (c. 800 BC) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with bitumen as a waterproofing agent.Bitumen was used by ancient Egyptians to embalm mummies.In the ancient Far East, natural bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions, leaving a thermoplastic material of higher molecular weight that when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Apollo spacecraft had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stagesxe2x80x94a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.After being sent to the Moon by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit.It was revealed in 1989 that the Soviets had tried to send people to the Moon, but were unable due to technological difficulties.The Apollo 11 landing is referenced in the songs "Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins" by The Byrds on the 1969 album Ballad of Easy Rider and "Coon on the Moon" by Howlin' Wolf on the 1973 album The Back Door Wolf.The command module Columbia went on a tour of the United States, visiting 49 state capitals, the District of Columbia, and Anchorage, Alaska.Columbia was moved in 2017 to the NASM Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, to be readied for a four-city tour titled Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission.Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable.By the normal crew rotation in place during Apollo, Lovell, Mattingly, and Haise were scheduled to fly on Apollo 14 after backing up for Apollo 11.A felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch.After more than  hours on the lunar surface, in addition to the scientific instruments, the astronauts left behind: an Apollo 1 mission patch in memory of astronauts& Roger Chaffee, Gus Grissom, and Edward White, who died when their command module caught fire during a test in January 1967; two memorial medals of Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin, who died in 1967 and 1968 respectively; a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace; and a silicon message disk carrying the goodwill statements by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon along with messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world.During his day flying solo around the Moon, Collins never felt lonely.Resolved at Talk:Apollo 11#Semi-protected edit request on 8 June 2019-->Other key personnel who played important roles in the Apollo 11 mission include the following.The Apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for "peaceful lunar landing by the United States".Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named Tranquility Base before lifting off to rejoin Columbia in lunar orbit.Apollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of NASA's Apollo program. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Apollo8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the Saturn V rocket, and was the first human spaceflight from the Kennedy Space Center, located adjacent to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.Originally planned as the second crewed Apollo Lunar Module and command module test, to be flown in an elliptical medium Earth orbit in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December, as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight.Astronaut Jim McDivitt's crew, who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit, became the crew for the Apollo9 mission, and Borman's crew were moved to the Apollo8 mission.The Apollo spacecraft therefore had three primary components: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that would return to Earth; a service module (SM) to provide the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a two-stage lunar module (LM), which comprised a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit.The S-IVB third stage injected the craft into Earth orbit and remained attached to perform the TLI burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the Moon.Once the vehicle reached Earth orbit, both the crew and Houston flight controllers spent the next 2hours and 38 minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for TLI.Apollo8 was planned as the "D" mission, a test of the LM in a low Earth orbit in December 1968 by James McDivitt, David Scott, and Russell Schweickart, while Borman's crew would fly the "E" mission, a more rigorous LM test in an elliptical medium Earth orbit as Apollo9, in early 1969. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> These are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely.Alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple Lewis bases due to their low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li<sup>+</sup> ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes).The alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated metal cation M<sup>+</sup> and solvated electron e<sup>xe2x88x92</sup>, which react to form hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide (MNH, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864.Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass.The alkali metals form many intermetallic compounds with each other and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries, An alloy of 41% caesium, 47% sodium, and 12% potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy, xe2x88x9278& xc2xb0C.The intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor conductors or semiconductors, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the Zintl anions involved.Boron is a special case, being the only nonmetal in group 13.Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due to the existence of copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time.The coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s<sup>1</sup> electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p<sup>6</sup>s<sup>1</sup>; group 11: d<sup>10</sup>s<sup>1</sup>).Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities,{| class="wikitable"The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other.The stable alkali metals are all silver-coloured metals except for caesium, which has a pale golden tint:All the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature.These substances include some elements and many more polyatomic ions; the polyatomic ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power.The element hydrogen, with one electron per neutral atom, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal;Hydrogen, like the alkali metals, has one valence electronOther "pseudo-alkali metals" include the alkylammonium cations, in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups.All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.All of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds: in order of abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; francium occurs only in minute traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains.The alkali metal borides tend to be boron-rich, involving appreciable boronxe2x80x93boron bonding involving deltahedral structures,Lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides, Li; sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium can form fullerides where n = 2, 3, 4, or 6, and rubidium and caesium additionally can achieve n = 1.When the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon group (silicon, germanium, tin, and lead), ionic substances with cage-like structures are formed, such as the silicides M (M = K, Rb, or Cs), which contains M<sup>+</sup> and tetrahedral  ions. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> An alphabet is a standardized set of basic written symbols or graphemes (called letters) that represent the phonemes of certain spoken languages. Not all writing systems represent language in this way; in a syllabary, each character represents a syllable, for instance, and logographic systems use characters to represent words, morphemes, or other semantic units. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Armenian word for "alphabet" is   (), named after the first two letters of the Armenian alphabet xd4xb1 xd5xa1xd5xb5xd5xa2 ayb and xd4xb2 xd5xa2xd5xa5xd5xb6 ben.Alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters, which can then be used for purposes of collationxe2x80x94namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called alphabetical order.The basic ordering of the Latin alphabet (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ), which is derived from the Northwest Semitic "Abgad" order,In German, words starting with sch- (which spells the German phoneme ) are inserted between words with initial sca- and sci- (all incidentally loanwords) instead of appearing after initial sz, as though it were a single letterxe2x80x94in contrast to several languages such as Albanian, in which dh-, xc3xab-, gj-, ll-, rr-, th-, xh- and zh- (all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters) would follow the letters d, e, g, l, n, r, t, x and z respectively, as well as Hungarian and Welsh.It eventually became used for the descendant languages of Latin (the Romance languages) and then for most of the other languages of Europe.Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures, such as xc3xa6 in Danish and Icelandic and xc8xa2 in Algonquian; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the thorn xc3xbe in Old English and Icelandic, which came from the Futhark runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the eth xc3xb0 of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modified d. Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, and Italian, which uses the letters j, k, x, y and w only in foreign words.Another notable script is Elder Futhark, which is believed to have evolved out of one of the Old Italic alphabets.The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the Wadi el-Hol script, believed to be an abjad, which through its successor Phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, Latin (via the Old Italic alphabet), Cyrillic (via the Greek alphabet) and Hebrew (via Aramaic).Examples of present-day abjads are the Arabic and Hebrew scripts; true alphabets include Latin, Cyrillic, and Korean hangul; and abugidas are used to write Tigrinya, Amharic, Hindi, and Thai.This organization is used in Southeast Asia, Tibet, Korean hangul, and even Japanese kana, which is not an alphabet.The Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound (acrophony), continue to be used to varying degrees in Samaritan, Aramaic, Syriac, Hebrew, Greek and Arabic.The names were abandoned in Latin, which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant; the two exceptions were Y and Z, which were borrowed from the Greek alphabet rather than Etruscan, and were known as Y Graeca "Greek Y" (pronounced I Graeca "Greek I") and zeta (from Greek)xe2x80x94this discrepancy was inherited by many European languages, as in the term zed for Z in all forms of English other than American English. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.In the scientific journal style, one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions, whereas variables are written using italics.For example, in mathematical journals the expressiondoes not denote the sine function, but theproduct of the three variablesCommas in multi-component subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted; this is also potentially ambiguous notation.For example, in the notation <math>T_{mnk}</math>, the reader can only infer from the context whether it means a single-index object, taken with the subscript equal to product of variables <math>m</math>, <math>n</math> and <math>k</math>, or it is an indication to a trivalent tensor.An expression such as <math>sin^2alpha/2</math> can be understood to mean either <math>(sin(alpha/2))^2</math> or <math>(sin alpha)^2/2</math>.Often the author's intention can be understood from the context, in cases where only one of the two makes sense, but an ambiguity like this should be avoided, for example by writing <math>sin^2(alpha/2)</math> or <math display="inline">frac{1}{2}sin^2alpha</math>.The expression <math>sin^{-1}alpha</math> means <math>arcsin(alpha)</math> in several texts, though it might be thought to mean <math>(sin alpha)^{-1}</math>, since <math>sin^{n} alpha</math> commonly means <math>(sin alpha)^{n}</math>. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the Dutch Caribbean.Aruba is one of the four countries that form the Kingdom of the Netherlands, along with the Netherlands, Curaxc3xa7ao, and Sint Maarten; the citizens of these countries are all Dutch nationals.There are different theories as to the origin of the name Aruba:There has been a human presence on Aruba from as early as circa 2000 BC.On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for its first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles, officially becoming a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with full independence planned for 1996.At a convention in The Hague in 1990, at the request of Aruba's Prime Minister Nelson Oduber, the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely Aruba's transition to full independence.}}In terms of country of birth, the population is estimated to be 66% Aruban, 9.1% Colombian, 4.3% Dutch, 4.1% Dominican, 3.2% Venezuelan, 2.2% Curaxc3xa7aoan, 1.5% Haitian, 1.2% Surinamese, 1.1% Peruvian, 1.1% Chinese, 6.2% other.In terms of ethnic composition, the population is estimated to be 75% mestizo and white, 15% black and 10% other ethnicities.Archaeological evidence suggests continuing links between these native Arubans and Amerindian peoples of mainland South America.The first Europeans to visit Aruba were Amerigo Vespucci and Alonso de Ojeda in 1499, who claimed the island for Spain.During the Napoleonic Wars the British Empire took control of the island, occupying it between 1806 and 1816, before handing it back to the Dutch as per the terms of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.The first oil refinery in Aruba was built in 1928 by Royal Dutch Shell. </my-abstract>

the North Atlantic Current, a branch of the Gulf Stream which flows northward from the Grand Banks; and the Subpolar Front, an extension of the North Atlantic Current, a wide, vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre.The wide range of salinities in the North Atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources: Labrador Sea, Norwegian-Greenland Sea, Mediterranean, and South Atlantic Intermediate Water.The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is a complex of four water masses, two that form by deep convection in the open ocean& xe2x80x94 Classical and Upper Labrador Sea Water& xe2x80x94 and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland sill& xe2x80x94 Denmark Strait and Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water.Municipal pollution comes from the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; oil pollution in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.North Atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature (SST) at tropical latitudes, changes that can be attributed to either the natural Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) or to anthropogenic climate change.A 2005 report indicated that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) slowed down by 30% between 1957 and 2004.The ocean mixed layer plays an important role in heat storage over seasonal and decadal time-scales, whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and have a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer.While nine of these have collectively been nominated a World Heritage Site for their geological value, four of them are considered of "Outstanding Universal Value" based on their cultural and natural criteria: xc3x9eingvellir, Iceland; Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture, Portugal; Gough and Inaccessible Islands, United Kingdom; and Brazilian Atlantic Islands: Fernando de Noronha and Atol das Rocas Reserves, Brazil.Continental shelves in the Atlantic are wide off Newfoundland, southernmost South America, and north-eastern Europe.In the western Atlantic carbonate platforms dominate large areas, for example, the Blake Plateau and Bermuda Rise.The Atlantic is surrounded by passive margins except at a few locations where active margins form deep trenches: the Puerto Rico Trench ( maximum depth) in the western Atlantic and South Sandwich Trench () in the South Atlantic.These include the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, part of the Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Labrador Sea, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, almost all of the Scotia Sea, and other tributary water bodies.Including its marginal seas, the Atlantic covers an area of  or 23.5% of the global ocean and has a volume of  or 23.3% of the total volume of the earth's oceans.Maximum salinity values occur at about 25xc2xb0 north and south, in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.The high surface salinity in the Atlantic, on which the Atlantic thermohaline circulation is dependent, is maintained by two processes: the Agulhas Leakage/Rings, which brings salty Indian Ocean waters into the South Atlantic, and the "Atmospheric Bridge", which evaporates subtropical Atlantic waters and exports it to the Pacific.The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major, upper water masses with distinct temperature and salinity.The most productive areas include the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, the Scotian Shelf, Georges Bank off Cape Cod, the Bahama Banks, the waters around Iceland, the Irish Sea, the Bay of Fundy, the Dogger Bank of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks.Fisheries have, however, undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the Atlantic: fisheries in the Eastern Central and South-West Atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value, the rest of the Atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and Plato, as Copernicus to Hicetas, Philolaus, and Aristarchus: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted.Schopenhauer writes about Kant's influence on his work in the preface to the second edition of The World as Will and Representation:Schopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work, The World as Will and Representation, to a detailed criticism of the Kantian philosophy.Schopenhauer praised Kant for his distinction between appearance and the thing-in-itself, whereas the general consensus in German Idealism was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory, since, according to Kant, causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot be the cause of appearances."Friedrich Nietzsche owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading The World as Will and Representation and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay "Schopenhauer als Erzieher" one of his Untimely Meditations.Early in his career, Ludwig Wittgenstein adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism, and some traits of Schopenhauer's influence (particularly Schopenhauerian trancendentalism) can be observed in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.Opposite to Russell on the foundations of mathematics, the Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer incorporated Kant's and Schopenhauer's ideas in intuitionism, where mathematics is considered a purely mental activity instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed.Writing shortly before the discovery of hyperbolic geometry demonstrated the logical independence of the axiomxe2x80x94and long before the general theory of relativity revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical spacexe2x80x94Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect concepts to prove what he held was directly evident from intuitive perception.Throughout his writings, Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.Although Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.This follows Kant's reasoning.The task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions.For him, a happy individual life in a world of suffering is like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the necessity of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:He named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason: the Will to Live or Will to Life (Wille zum Leben), defined as an inherent drive within human beings, and all creatures, to stay alive; a force that inveiglesIt has often been argued that Schopenhauer's thoughts on sexuality foreshadowed the theory of evolution, a claim met with satisfaction by Darwin as he included a quote of the German philosopher in his Descent of Man.While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his methodology was resolutely empirical, rather than speculative or transcendental:Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.Also note:This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.The argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other Dharmic faith loses credence since he did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of The World as Will and Representation in 1818.Schopenhauer's philosophy of the will as the essential reality behind the world as representation is often called metaphysical voluntarism.For Schopenhauer, understanding the world as will leads to ethical concerns (see the ethics section below for further detail), which he explores in the Fourth Book of The World as Will and Representation and again in his two prize essays on ethics, On the Freedom of the Will and On the Basis of Morality. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> BODIVA (Angola Stock Exchange and Derivatives, in English) received the secondary public debt market, and it is expected to start the corporate debt market by 2015, but the stock market should be a reality only in 2016.The Economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60% of Angola's economy, almost all of the country's revenue and all of its dominant exports.According to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative American think tank, oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China's biggest supplier of oil.In 2002 Angola demanded compensation for oil spills allegedly caused by Chevron Corporation, the first time it had fined a multinational corporation operating in its waters.Access to biocapacity in Angola is higher than world average.However, almost half the population has to be considered poor, with dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities (where by now slightly more than 50% of the people live).A study carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estatxc3xadstica found that in rural areas roughly 58% must be classified as "poor" according to UN norms, but in the urban areas only 19%, and an overall rate of 37%.In January 2020, a leak of government documents known as the Luanda Leaks showed that U.S. consulting companies such as Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey & Company, and PricewaterhouseCoopers had helped members of the family of former President Josxc3xa9 Eduardo dos Santos (especially his daughter Isabel dos Santos) corruptly run Sonangol for their own personal profit, helping them use the company's revenues to fund vanity projects in France and Switzerland.The enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the Angolan economy, illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in Luanda and neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression.One of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad.According to a study on the banking sector, carried out by Deloitte, the monetary policy led by Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA), the Angolan national bank, allowed a decrease in the inflation rate put at 7.96% in December 2013, which contributed to the sector's growth trend.Although the country's economy has grown significantly since Angola achieved political stability in 2002, mainly due to fast-rising earnings in the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems.Completing the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made.The telecommunications industry is considered one of the main strategic sectors in Angola.In October 2014, the building of an optic fiber underwater cable was announced.On 11 March 2015, the First Angolan Forum of Telecommunications and Information Technology was held in Luanda under the motto "The challenges of telecommunications in the current context of Angola",The first Angolan satellite, AngoSat-1, was launched into orbit on 26 December 2017.The management of the top-level domain '.ao' passed from Portugal to Angola in 2015, following new legislation.=Demographics={|class="wikitable" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px"Angola has a population of 24,383,301 inhabitants according to the preliminary results of its 2014 census, the first one conducted or carried out since 15 December 1970."Angola 2014" Retrieved from [http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org www.africaneconomicoutlook.org] In addition, the World Bank estimates that "less than 3 percent of Angola's abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited" .Before independence in 1975, Angola was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of bananas, coffee and sisal, but three decades of civil war (1975xe2x80x932002) destroyed fertile countryside, left it littered with landmines and drove millions into the cities.The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from South Africa and Portugal, while more than 90% of farming is done at the family and subsistence level.Food prices rose and acute malnutrition rates doubled, with more than 95,000 children affected.Josxc3xa9 Eduardo dos Santos stepped down as President of Angola after 38 years in 2017, being peacefully succeeded by Joxc3xa3o Lourenxc3xa7o, Santos' chosen successor.At ,Angola's capital, Luanda, lies on the Atlantic coast in the northwest of the country.Angola, although located in a tropical zone, has a climate uncharacteristic of this zone, due to the confluence of three factors:Angola's climate features two seasons:While the coastline has high rainfall rates, decreasing from north to south and from  to , with average annual temperatures above , one can divide the interior zone into three areas:The Angolan government is composed of three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial.John Iliffe notes that "Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys".During the Portuguese Restoration War, the Dutch West India Company occupied the principal settlement of Luanda in 1641, using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against Portuguese holdings elsewhere.The slave trade was abolished in Angola in 1836, and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He spent 1860 in Kentucky until December 21, when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific.At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army Department of the PacificSoon, Johnston enlisted in the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles as a private, leaving Warner's Ranch May 27.Early in the Civil War, Confederate President Jefferson Davis decided that the Confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible, and therefore distributed military forces around its borders and coasts.The most sensitive, and in many ways the most crucial areas, along the Mississippi River and in western Tennessee along the Tennessee and the Cumberland riversOn September 10, 1861, Johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the Confederacy west of the Allegheny Mountains, except for coastal areas.Union casualties were 500 killed, 2,108 wounded, 224 missing.Johnston, who had little choice in allowing Floyd and Pillow to take charge at Fort Donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison, took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the Confederate position.Johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off.Johnston's army of 17,000 men gave the Confederates a combined force of about 40,000 to 44,669 men at Corinth.Johnston now planned to defeat the Union forces piecemeal before the various Union units in Kentucky and Tennessee under Grant with 40,000 men at nearby Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, and the now Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell on his way from Nashville with 35,000 men, could unite against him.Johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against Grant at the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, 1862.At about 2:30& pm, while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the "Peach Orchard," he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The Friedmann-Einstein universe of 1931In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his "biggest blunder".In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ramxc3xb3n y Cajal and also received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences.From 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923xe2x80x931924), Einstein's former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee.In December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology.So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.In a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta).Schrxc3xb6dinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.In 1926, Einstein and his former student Lexc3xb3 Szilxc3xa1rd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator.With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father, he secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office,Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter.Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electricalxe2x80x93mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Kxc3xb6chel catalog of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the Zoellner Quartet.In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party.Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi."Throughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles.The Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc<sup>2</sup> that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905.The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director.Based on calculations Einstein had made in 1911 using his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the Sun's gravity. </my-abstract>

O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution estimated that if Afghanistan generates about $10& billion per year from its mineral deposits, its gross national product would double and provide long-term funding for Afghan security forces and other critical needs.<!--deadurl=https://news.yahoo.com/afghanistan-signs-7-bn-oil-deal-china-102107384.html-->The country has significant amounts of lithium, copper, gold, coal, iron ore, and other minerals.Access to biocapacity in Afghanistan is lower than world average.Amid a state of anarchy and factional infighting, The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their interpretation of Islamic sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially women.In October 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power after they refused to hand over Osama Bin Laden, the prime suspect of the September 11 attacks, who was a "guest" of the Taliban and was operating his al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan.Taliban forces meanwhile began regrouping inside Pakistan, while more coalition troops entered Afghanistan to help the rebuilding process.In September 2014 Ashraf Ghani became president after the 2014 presidential election where for the first time in Afghanistan's history power was democratically transferred.The National Museum of Afghanistan is located in Kabul and hosts a large number of Buddhist, Bactrian Greek and early Islamic antiquities; the museum suffered greatly by civil war but has been slowly restoring since the early 2000s.Telecommunication services in Afghanistan are provided by Afghan Telecom, Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, MTN Group, and Roshan.The modern Constitution of Afghanistan, however, states that the word "Afghan" shall apply to every citizen of Afghanistan.Many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in Afghanistan, such as the Greco-Bactrians, Sakas, Kushans, Kidarites, Hephthalites, Alkhons, Nezaks, Zunbils, Turk Shahis, Hindu Shahis, Lawiks, Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Khwarazmians, Khaljis, Kartids, Timurids, Lodis, Surs, Mughals, and Safavids, and finally, the Hotak and Durrani dynasties, which marked the political origins of the modern state.As there was no colonialism in the modern era in Afghanistan, European-style architecture is rare; most notably the Victory Arch at Paghman, and the Darul Aman Palace in Kabul, were built in this style in the 1920s by the Afghans themselves.Carpet weaving is an ancient practice in Afghanistan, and many of these are still handmade by tribal and nomadic people today.Pottery has been crafted in Afghanistan for millennia.In 1973, while the King was in Italy, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first President of Afghanistan, abolishing the monarchy.In April 1978, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) seized power in a bloody coup d'xc3xa9tat against then-President Mohammed Daoud Khan, in what is called the Saur Revolution. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The History of Skanderbeg is still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.During the 16th and the 17th centuries, the catechism (E mbxc3xabsuame krishterxc3xab) (Christian Teachings) from 1592 written by Lekxc3xab Matrxc3xabnga, (Doktrina e krishterxc3xab) (The Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and (Rituale romanum) 1621 by Pjetxc3xabr Budi, the first writer of original Albanian prose and poetry, an apology for George Castriot (1636) by Frang Bardhi, who also published a dictionary and folklore creations, the theological-philosophical treaty Cuneus Prophetarum (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by Pjetxc3xabr Bogdani, the most universal personality of Albanian Middle Ages, were published in Albanian.On 7 March, he arrived in the provisional capital of Durrxc3xabs and started to organise his government, appointing Turhan Pasha Pxc3xabrmeti to form the first Albanian cabinet.In November 1913, the Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne of Albania to the Ottoman war Minister of Albanian origin, Ahmed Izzet Pasha.In February 1914, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was proclaimed in Gjirokastxc3xabr by the local Greek population against incorporation to Albania.Other significant examples include: a baptism formula (Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit) from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of Durrxc3xabs, Pal Engjxc3xablli; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the Gospel of Matthew, also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too.Football arrived in Albania early in the 20th century when the inhabitants of the northern city of Shkodxc3xabr were surprised to see a strange game being played by students at a Christian mission.The Albania national football team, ranking 51st in the World in 2017 (highest 22nd on 22 August 2015) have won the 1946 Balkan Cup and the Malta Rothmans International Tournament 2000, but had never participated in any major UEFA or FIFA tournament, until UEFA Euro 2016, Albania's first ever appearance at the continental tournament and at a major men's football tournament.It possesses significant diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab, Skanderbeg, Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea.Historically, Albania has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians, Thracians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Venetians and Ottomans.Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century, the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe. Between the 18th and 19th centuries, cultural developments, widely attributed to Albanians having gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength, conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance.On the contrary, the coldest areas are positioned within the northern and eastern highlands.The Albanian Alps in the far north of the country are considered to be among the most humid regions of Europe, receiving at least  of rain annually.Snowfall occurs frequently in winter in the highlands of the country, particularly on the mountains in the north and east, including the Albanian Alps and Korab Mountains. </my-abstract>

the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918, when the National Army of the newly formed Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was created on 26 June 1918.As of 2002, Azerbaijan had 95,000 active personnel in its armed forces.Numerous self-ruling khanates with various forms of autonomyFollowing Qajar Iran's loss in the 1804xe2x80x931813 war, it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates, along with Georgia and Dagestan to the Russian Empire, per the Treaty of Gulistan.The area to the north of the river Aras, amongst which territory lies the contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, was Iranian territory until it was occupied by Russia in the 19th century.Qajar Iran was forced to cede its Caucasian territories to Russia in the 19th century, which thus included the territory of the modern-day Azerbaijan Republic, while as a result of that cession, the Azerbaijani ethnic group is nowadays parted between two nations: Iran and Azerbaijan.Operation Edelweiss carried out by the German Wehrmacht targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy (petroleum) dynamo of the USSR.Following the politics of glasnost, initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev, civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh,The early years of independence were overshadowed by the Nagorno-Karabakh war with the ethnic Armenian majority of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by Armenia.In 1993, democratically elected president Abulfaz Elchibey was overthrown by a military insurrection led by Colonel Surat Huseynov, which resulted in the rise to power of the former leader of Soviet Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev.Ilham Aliyev, Heydar Aliyev's son, became chairman of the New Azerbaijan Party as well as

(on border with "partly free") by Freedom House.Azerbaijan has been harshly criticized for bribing foreign officials and diplomats in order to promote its causes abroad and legitimize its elections at home, a practice which has been termed as Caviar diplomacy.The short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic succeeded in establishing diplomatic relations with six countries, sending diplomatic representatives to Germany and Finland.Azerbaijan has diplomatic relations with 158 countries so far and holds membership in 38 international organizations.Azerbaijan is an active member of international coalitions fighting international terrorism.This led to the launch of a new currency, the new Azerbaijani manat, on 1 January 2006, to cement the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy.In 2008, Azerbaijan was cited as one of the top 10 reformers by the World Bank's Doing Business Report.Azerbaijan is also ranked 57th in the Global Competitiveness Report for

<my-abstract> Because of its simplicity, star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to naked-eye stars.More advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include telescope mounts with setting circles, which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest, and GOTO telescopes, which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand (having first been calibrated).The advent of mobile applications for use in smartphones has led to the creation of many dedicated apps.Setting circles are angular measurement scales that can be placed on the two main rotation axes of some telescopes.However, several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of built-in GPS, decreasing the time it takes to set up a telescope at the start of an observing session.With the development of fast Internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in computer controlled telescope mounts and CCD cameras "Remote Telescope" astronomy is now a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep sky imaging. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The characters aeteological history can be traced back to the much older Chinese character of qi xe6xb0xa3 that is used extensively in Traditional Chinese medicine and acupunture.The term  in Aikido is derived from the word Tao, xe9x81x93 in Chinese, and is found in many other Japanese martial arts such as, judo and kendo, and in various non-martial arts, such as Japanese calligraphy (), flower arranging () and tea ceremony ().Therefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the "Way of combining forces" or "Way of unifying energy", in which the term aiki refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.The art of Daitxc5x8d-ryxc5xab is the primary technical influence on aikido.The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (uke) to initiate an attack against the person who applies the techniquexe2x80x94the  tori, or shite  (depending on aikido style), also referred to as  nage (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.Both halves of the technique, that of uke and that of tori, are considered essential to aikido training. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> By the end of 1781, the Americans had effectively confined the British to the Carolina coasts, undoing any progress they had made in the previous year.Spanish Louisiana, Luisiana territory ran west of the Mississippi River, but Governor General Gxc3xa1lvez had been allowing covert aid to George Washington by Pittsburgh via New Orleans.In the Virginia militia campaign of 1778, General George Rogers Clark founded Louisville, and cleared British forts in the region.At the Spanish declaration of war with France in 1779, Governor Gxc3xa1lvez raised an army in Spanish Louisiana to initiate offensive operations against British outposts.In 1781, Governor Galvez and Pollack campaigned east along the Gulf Coast to secure West Florida including British-held Mobile and Pensacola.In 1781, the British commander-in-chief in America General Clinton garrisoned in New York City.Spanish claims added French cessions from French Louisiana east to the Mississippi River.|<center>British and Spanish claims, 1763-1783<br>British gained from French and Spanish; Spanish got French Louisiana for a buffer</center>File:The British colonies in North America.jpg |upright=1.0|alt=MAP of the British North American colonies in 1777.Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown and the loss of a secondBritish army to the Continental Army effectively ended British attempts to retake America.General Carleton had repelled the American assault on Quebec in 1775, but he had been passed over for advancement by General Burgoyne because of his reputation for over-caution.By the end of hostilities in America at the close of 1781, the British Army numbered approximately 121,000 men globally,;HessiansIn 1775 at the onset of the American War of Independence, without sufficient popular support, the British soon realized they needed greater numbers of soldiers to subdue the rebellion in colonial America.Carlton then successfully managed the British evacuation of American port cities in Savannah, Charleston and New York City.In 1775, the standing British Army, exclusive of militia, comprised 45,123 men worldwide, including 8500 men stationed in North America.Through the American crises of 1775, the British leadership discovered it had overestimated the capabilities of its own troops, while underestimating those of the colonists.This stiffened British resolve with a significant effect on the peace negotiations for the French and Spanish Versailles treaties.More British victories followed, culminating in September 1782, when they inflicted a huge defeat on the anticipated Franco-Spanish assault at Gibraltar - the largest battle in the entire war.Britain signed preliminary agreements with France and Spain to end their European war in separate treaties, signing an additional conclusive Anglo-French Treaty of Versailles on 20 January 1783 and then the conclusive Anglo-Spanish Treaty of Versailles (1783).Washington expressed astonishment that the Americans had won a war against a leading world power, referring to the American victory as "little short of a standing miracle".But then British maneuvering north led to a combined American and French force cornering a second British army at Battle of Yorktown, and their surrender effectively ended the Revolutionary War.Sir Thomas Gage, the British Commander-in-Chief in America 1763-1775 and sitting Governor of Massachusetts, gathered intelligence of a Patriot plan to destroy stores of militia ordnance at Concord.Knowlton's Rangers became the Army's first intelligence unit.When Washington split his army to positions on Manhattan Island and across the East River in western Long Island.General Howe officially met with a delegation from Congress at the September Staten Island Peace Conference, but it failed to conclude peace as the British delegates did not have authority to recognize independence, only offer pardons.Washington's retreat isolated the remaining forces and the British captured their Fort Washington on November 16.Any significant level of organized Loyalist activity required a continued presence of British regulars.During the early war policy administered by General Lord Howe, the need to maintain Loyalist support prevented the British from using the harsh methods of suppressing revolts that they had used in Scotland and Ireland.One outstanding Loyalist militia unit provided some of the best troops in the British service.Women played various roles during the Revolutionary War. </my-abstract>

Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:
; Brute-force or exhaustive search
; Divide and conquer
; Search and enumeration
;Randomized algorithm
# Monte Carlo algorithms return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. RP is the subclass of these that run in polynomial time.
# Las Vegas algorithms always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. ZPP.
; Reduction of complexity
; Back tracking
 , 
For optimization problems there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:
; Linear programming
George B. Dantzig and Mukund N. Thapa. 2003. Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extensions. Springer-Verlag.</ref> Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the maximum flow problem for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an integer then it is classified in integer programming. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.
; Dynamic programming
; The greedy method
;The heuristic method
 , 
Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are search algorithms, sorting algorithms, merge algorithms, numerical algorithms, graph algorithms, string algorithms, computational geometric algorithms, combinatorial algorithms, medical algorithms, machine learning, cryptography, data compression algorithms and parsing techniques.
Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.
 , 
Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:
Some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.
 , 
The adjective "continuous" when applied to the word "algorithm" can mean:
Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute "processes" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in Gottschalk v. Benson). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in Diamond v. Diehr, the application of a simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of synthetic rubber was deemed patentable. The patenting of software is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially data compression algorithms, such as Unisys' LZW patent.
Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see export of cryptography).
 , 
 , 
The earliest  evidence of algorithms is found in the Babylonian mathematics of ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). A Sumerian clay tablet found in Shuruppak near Baghdad and dated to circa 2500 BC described the earliest division algorithm.
Algorithms for arithmetic are also found in ancient Egyptian mathematics, dating back to the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus circa 1550 BC.
 , 
Tally-marks: To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually Roman numerals and the abacus evolved (Dilson, p.& 16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in unary numeral system arithmetic used in Turing machine and Post–Turing machine computations.

Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, a Persian mathematician, wrote the Al-jabr in the 9th century. The terms "algorism" and "algorithm" are derived from the name al-Khwārizmī, while the term "algebra" is derived from the book Al-jabr. In Europe, the word "algorithm" was originally used to refer to the sets of rules and techniques used by Al-Khwarizmi to solve algebraic equations, before later being generalized to refer to any set of rules or techniques.
 , 
The first cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code was developed by Al-Kindi, a 9th-century Arab mathematician, in A Manuscript On Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest codebreaking algorithm.
 , 
The clock: Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven clock as "The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]", in particular, the verge escapement Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer—Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a real Turing-complete computer instead of just a calculator—and is sometimes called "history's first programmer" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.
Logical machines 1870 – Stanley Jevons' "logical abacus" and "logical machine": The technical problem was to reduce Boolean equations when presented in a form similar to what is now known as Karnaugh maps. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple "abacus" of "slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically ... More recently, however, I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a Logical Machine" His machine came equipped with "certain moveable wooden rods" and "at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] ...". With this machine he could analyze a "syllogism or any other simple logical argument".
This machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society.
Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony – the electromechanical relay: Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the Jacquard loom (1801), precursor to Hollerith cards (punch cards, 1887), and "telephone switching technologies" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers. By the mid-19th century the telegraph, the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as "dots and dashes" a common sound. By the late 19th century the ticker tape (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the teleprinter (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of Baudot code on tape.
Telephone-switching networks of electromechanical relays (invented 1835) was behind the work of George Stibitz (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the "burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. "He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device".
Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two "binary states" open and closed):
 , 
Symbols and rules: In rapid succession, the mathematics of George Boole (1847, 1854), Gottlob Frege (1879), and Giuseppe Peano (1888–1889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method (1888) was "the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language".
But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is "perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a " 'formula language', that is a lingua characterica, a language written with special symbols, "for pure thought", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules". The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell in their Principia Mathematica (1910–1913).
The paradoxes: At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular, the Burali-Forti paradox (1897), the Russell paradox (1902–03), and the Richard Paradox. The resultant considerations led to Kurt Gödel's paper (1931)—he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of recursion to numbers.
Effective calculability: In an effort to solve the Entscheidungsproblem defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an "effective method" or "effective calculation" or "effective calculability" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: Alonzo Church, Stephen Kleene and J.B. Rosser's λ-calculus
 , 
Emil Post (1936) described the actions of a "computer" (human being) as follows:
His symbol space would be
Alan Turing's work Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we might conjecture that all were influences.
Turing—his model of computation is now called a Turing machine—begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and "states of mind". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.
Turing's reduction yields the following:
"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must, therefore, be taken to be one of the following:
A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:
 , 
J. Barkley Rosser defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):
Rosser's footnote No. 5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paper On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–37) in their mechanism-models of computation.
Stephen C. Kleene defined as his now-famous "Thesis I" known as the Church–Turing thesis. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):
 , 
A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of "algorithm", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, foundations of mathematics (especially the Church–Turing thesis) and philosophy of mind (especially arguments about artificial intelligence).

<title>Mouthwash</title>
<wiki-abstract> Mouthwash, mouth rinse, oral rinse, or mouth bath is a liquid which is held in the mouth passively or swilled around the mouth by contraction of the perioral muscles and/or movement of the head, and may be gargled, where the head is tilted back and the liquid bubbled at the back of the mouth. </wiki-abstract>

<headings> 
The most common use of mouthwash is commercial antiseptics, which are used at home as part of an oral hygiene routine. Examples of commercial mouthwashes companies include Cēpacol, Colgate, Corsodyl, Dentyl pH, Listerine, Odol, Oral-B, Sarakan, Scope, Tantum verde, and Biotene. Mouthwashes combine ingredients to treat a variety of oral conditions. Variations are common, and mouthwash has no standard formulation so its use and recommendation involves concerns about patient safety. Some manufacturers of mouthwash state that antiseptic and anti-plaque mouth rinse kill the bacterial plaque that causes cavities, gingivitis, and bad breath. It is, however, generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both brushing and flossing. Soreness, ulceration and redness may sometimes occur (e.g. aphthous stomatitis, allergic contact stomatitis) if the person is allergic or sensitive to mouthwash ingredients such as preservatives, coloring, flavors and fragrances. Such effects might be reduced or eliminated by diluting the mouthwash with water, using a different mouthwash (e.g. salt water), or foregoing mouthwash entirely.
Prescription mouthwashes are used prior to and after oral surgery procedures such as tooth extraction or to treat the pain associated with mucositis caused by radiation therapy or chemotherapy. They are also prescribed for aphthous ulcers, other oral ulcers, and other mouth pain. Despite a lack of evidence that prescription mouthwashes are more effective in decreasing the pain of oral lesions, many patients and prescribers continue to use them. There has been only one controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of magic mouthwash; it shows no difference in efficacy among the most common formulation and commercial mouthwashes such as chlorhexidine or a saline/baking soda solution. Current guidelines suggest that saline solution is just as effective as magic mouthwash in pain relief or shortening of healing time of oral mucositis from cancer therapies.
 ,  
The first known references to mouth rinsing is in Ayurveda
Before Europeans came to the Americas, Native North American and Mesoamerican cultures used mouthwashes, often made from plants such as Coptis trifolia.
Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the famous 17th century microscopist, discovered living organisms (living, because they were mobile) in deposits on the teeth (what we now call dental plaque). He also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in Delft. He experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water. Next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a mouthwash containing vinegar or brandy and found that living organisms remained in the dental plaque. He concluded—correctly—that the mouthwash either did not reach, or was not present long enough, to kill the plaque organisms.
Since then commercial interest in mouthwashes has been intense and several newer products claim effectiveness in reducing the build-up in dental plaque and the associated severity of gingivitis, in addition to fighting bad breath. Many of these solutions aim to control the Volatile Sulfur Compound (VSC)-creating anaerobic bacteria that live in the mouth and excrete substances that lead to bad breath and unpleasant mouth taste.
 , 
 , 
Alcohol is added to mouthwash not to destroy bacteria but to act as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients such as menthol, eucalyptol and thymol which help to penetrate plaque. Many newer brands of mouthwash are alcohol free, not just in response to consumer concerns about oral cancer, but also to cater for religious groups who abstain from alcohol consumption.
 , 
In painful oral conditions such as aphthous stomatitis, analgesic mouthrinses (e.g. benzydamine mouthwash, or "Difflam") are sometimes used to ease pain, commonly used before meals to reduce discomfort while eating.
 , 
Acts as a buffer.
 , 
Betamethasone is sometimes used as an anti-inflammatory, corticosteroid mouthwash. It may be used for severe inflammatory conditions of the oral mucosa such as the severe forms of aphthous stomatitis.
 , 
Cetylpyridinium chloride containing mouthwash (e.g. 0.05%) is used in some specialized mouthwashes for halitosis.

In traditional Ayurvedic medicine, the use of oil mouthwashes is called "Kavala" ("oil swishing") or "Gandusha", Ayurvedic literature suggests oil pulling is capable of improving oral and systemic health, including a benefit in conditions such as headaches, migraines, diabetes mellitus, asthma,
Oil pulling has received little study and there is little evidence to support claims made by the technique's advocates. Sesame oil, coconut oil and ghee are traditionally used,
 , 
Phenolic compounds and monoterpenes include essential oil constituents that have some antibacterial properties, phenol,
Essential oils are oils which have been extracted from plants. Mouthwashes based on essential oils could be more effective than traditional mouthcare - for anti-gingival treatments. Most people using fluoridated toothpastes do not require fluoride-containing mouth rinses, rather fluoride mouthwashes are sometimes used in individuals who are at high risk of dental decay, due to dental caries ("cavities") or people with xerostomia.
 , 
Flavoring agents include sweeteners such as sorbitol, sucralose, sodium saccharin, and xylitol, which stimulate salivary function due to their sweetness and taste and helps restore the mouth to a neutral level of acidity.
Xylitol rinses double as a bacterial inhibitor and have been used as substitute for Alcohol to avoid dryness of mouth associated with Alcohol.
 , 
Hydrogen peroxide can be used as an oxidizing mouthwash (e.g. Peroxyl, 1.5%). It kills anaerobic bacteria, and also has a mechanical cleansing action when it froths as it comes into contact with debris in mouth.
 , 
Enzymes and proteins such as Lactoperoxidase, Lysozyme, Lactoferrin have been used in mouthrinses (e.g. Biotene) to reduce oral bacteria and hence the acid produced by bacteria.
 , 
Oral lidocaine is useful for the treatment of mucositis symptoms (inflammation of mucous membranes) that is induced by radiation or chemotherapy.
 , 
Methyl salicylate functions as an anti-septic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, flavoring, and fragrance. Methyl salicylate has some anti-plaque action, but less than chlorhexidine.
 , 
Nystatin suspension is an antifungal ingredient used for the treatment of oral candidiasis.
 , 
A 2005 study found that gargling three times a day with simple water or with a Povidone-iodine solution was effective in preventing upper respiratory infection and decreasing the severity of symptoms if contracted.
 , 
Sanguinarine-containing mouthwashes are marketed as anti-plaque and anti-malodor. Ironically, elements within the complementary and alternative medicine industry promote the use of sanguinaria as a therapy for cancer.
 , 
Sodium bicarbonate is sometimes combined with salt to make a simple homemade mouthwash, indicated for any of the reasons that a salt water mouthwash might be used. Pre-mixed mouthwashes of 1% sodium bicarbonate and 1.5% sodium chloride in aqueous solution are marketed, although pharmacists will easily be able to produce such a formulation from the base ingredients when required. Sodium bicarbonate mouthwash is sometimes used to remove viscous saliva and to aid visualization of the oral tissues during examination of the mouth.
Salt water mouth wash is made by dissolving 0.5–1 teaspoon of table salt into a cup of water, In dental extractions, hot salt water mouthbaths should start about 24 hours after a dental extraction.
 , 
Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) is used as a foaming agent in many oral hygiene products including many mouthwashes. Some may suggest that it is probably advisable to use mouthwash at least an hour after brushing with toothpaste when the toothpaste contains SLS, since the anionic compounds in the SLS toothpaste can deactivate cationic agents present in the mouthrinse.
 , 
Sucralfate is a mucosal coating agent, composed of an aluminum salt of sulfated sucrose. It is not recommended for use in the prevention of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy or chemoradiation due to a lack of efficacy found in a well-designed, randomized controlled trial.
 , 
Tetracycline is an antibiotic which may sometimes be used as a mouthwash in adults (it causes red staining of teeth in children). It is sometimes use for herpetiforme ulceration (an uncommon type of aphthous stomatitis), but prolonged use may lead to oral candidiasis as the fungal population of the mouth overgrows in the absence of enough competing bacteria.
 , 
4.8% tranexamic acid solution is sometimes used as an antifibrinolytic mouthwash to prevent bleeding during and after oral surgery in persons with coagulopathies (clotting disorders) or who are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners such as warfarin).
 , 
Triclosan is a non-ionic chlorinate bisphenol antiseptic found in some mouthwashes.
 , 
Astringents like zinc chloride provide a pleasant-tasting sensation and shrink tissues.
 , 
While mouthwash is traditionally mint flavored, Listerine sells citrus flavored mouthwash as well, and Oxyfresh sells mouthwash flavored as lemon mint and unflavored. The company Closys sells unflavored mouthwash with flavor control, with a special mouthwash for seniors.

<my-abstract> Together with the Acorales, the Alismatales are referred to informally as the alismatid monocots.The Cronquist system (1981) places the Alismatales in subclass Alismatidae, class Liliopsida [= monocotyledons] and includes only three families as shown:Cronquist's subclass Alismatidae conformed fairly closely to the order Alismatales as defined by APG, minus the Araceae.The Dahlgren system places the Alismatales in the superorder Alismatanae in the subclass Liliidae [= monocotyledons] in the class Magnoliopsida [= angiosperms] with the following families included:In Tahktajan's classification (1997), the order Alismatales contains only the Alismataceae and Limnocharitaceae, making it equivalent to the Alismataceae as revised in APG-III.The rest of the families together contain only about five hundred species, many of which are in very small families.The APG III system (2009) differs only in that the Limnocharitaceae are combined with the Alismataceae; it was also suggested that the genus Maundia (of the Juncaginaceae) could be separated into a monogeneric family, the Maundiaceae, but the authors noted that more study was necessary before the Maundiaceae could be recognized.In APG IV (2016), it was decided that evidence was sufficient to elevate Maundia to family level as the monogeneric Maundiaceae. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> 4& Vesta is the second-largest asteroid visited to date.On 13& December 2012, China's lunar orbiter Chang'e 2 flew within  of the asteroid 4179 Toutatis on an extended mission.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the Hayabusa2 probe in December& 2014, and plans to return samples from 162173 Ryugu in December& 2020.In June& 2018, the US National Science and Technology Council warned that America is unprepared for an asteroid impact event, and has developed and released the "National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy Action Plan" to better prepare.In September& 2016, NASA launched the OSIRIS-REx sample return mission to asteroid 101955 Bennu, which it reached in December& 2018. , the probe is in orbit around the asteroid.In early 2013, NASA announced the planning stages of a mission to capture a near-Earth asteroid and move it into lunar orbit where it could possibly be visited by astronauts and later impacted into the Moon.It has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on Earth (asteroid mining), or materials for constructing space habitats (see Colonization of the asteroids).These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the Voyager probes of the small moons of the gas giants.The first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was 951 Gaspra in 1991, followed in 1993 by 243 Ida and its moon Dactyl, all of which were imaged by the Galileo probe en route to Jupiter.The first dedicated asteroid probe was NEAR Shoemaker, which photographed 253 Mathilde in 1997, before entering into orbit around 433 Eros, finally landing on its surface in 2001.Other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include 9969 Braille (by Deep Space 1 in 1999), and 5535 Annefrank (by Stardust in 2002).From September to November& 2005, the Japanese Hayabusa probe studied 25143 Itokawa in detail and was plagued with difficulties, but returned samples of its surface to Earth on 13& June 2010.The European Rosetta probe (launched in 2004) flew by 2867 xc5xa0teins in 2008 and 21 Lutetia, the third-largest asteroid visited to date, in 2010.In September& 2007, NASA launched the Dawn spacecraft, which orbited 4 Vesta from July& 2011 to September& 2012, and has been orbiting the dwarf planet 1& Ceres since 2015.The term "asteroid", from the Greek word for "star-like", never had a formal definition, with the broader term minor planet being preferred by the International Astronomical Union.However, following the discovery of asteroids below ten meters in size, Rubin and Grossman's 2010 paper revised the previous definition of meteoroid to objects between 10& xc2xb5m and 1& meter in size in order to maintain the distinction between asteroids and meteoroids.In 2006, the term "small Solar System body" was also introduced to cover both most minor planets and comets.For almost two centuries, from the discovery of Ceres in 1801 until the discovery of the first centaur, Chiron in 1977, all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of Jupiter, though a few such as Hidalgo ventured far beyond Jupiter for part of their orbit.Organic compounds were also detected on the surface.In October 2013, water was detected on an extrasolar body for the first time, on an asteroid orbiting the white dwarf GD 61.In May& 2016, significant asteroid data arising from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and NEOWISE missions have been questioned.In November 2019, scientists reported detecting, for the first time, sugar molecules, including ribose, in meteorites, suggesting that chemical processes on asteroids can produce some fundamentally essential bio-ingredients important to life, and supporting the notion of an RNA world prior to a DNA-based origin of life on Earth, and possibly, as well, the notion of panspermia.Most asteroids outside the "big four" (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Hygiea) are likely to be broadly similar in appearance, if irregular in shape.As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered that were found to have volatile-rich surfaces similar to comets, these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main asteroid belt.In this article, the term "asteroid" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System, including those co-orbital with Jupiter.Millions of asteroids exist, many are shattered remnants of planetesimals, bodies within the young Sun's solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets. </my-abstract>

<title>Affidavit</title>
<wiki-abstract> An affidavit ( ; Medieval Latin for he has declared under oath) is a written statement of fact voluntarily made by an affiant or deponent under an oath or affirmation which is administered by a person who is authorized to do so by law. Such a statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiant's signature by a taker of oaths, such as a notary public or commissioner of oaths. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> South Parks "Chinpokomon" and "Good Times with Weapons" episodes, Adult Swim's Perfect Hair Forever, and Nickelodeon's Kappa Mikey are Western examples of satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime, but anime tropes have also been satirized by some anime, such as KonoSuba.Traditionally only Japanese works have been considered anime, but some works have sparked debate for blurring the lines between anime and cartoons, such as the American anime style production Avatar: The Last Airbender.The web-based series RWBY, produced by Texas-based company Rooster Teeth, is produced using an anime art style, and  the series has been described as "anime" by multiple sources.Anime enthusiasts have produced fan fiction and fan art, including computer wallpapers and anime music videos.As of the 2010s, many anime fans use online communities and databases such as MyAnimeList to discuss anime and track their progress watching respective series.One of the key points that made anime different from a handful of Western cartoons is the potential for visceral content.Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.Prior to the digital era, anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose approach.Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He also had a horse delivered to the dressing room of his friend, actor Sir Gerald du Maurier.Hitchcock's next major success was The Lady Vanishes (1938), "one of the greatest train movies from the genre's golden era", according to Philip French, in which Miss Froy (May Whitty), a British spy posing as a governess, disappears on a train journey through the fictional European country of Bandrika.David O. Selznick signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in March 1939, and the Hitchcocks moved to Hollywood.Selznick lent Hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing Hitchcock's films himself.Hitchcock uses close-ups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions, "from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment".From 1955 to 1965, Hitchcock was the host of the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents.His introductions always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one electric chair, while two are shown with a sign "Two chairsxe2x80x94no waiting!"That's writing.' xe2x80x9c Recalling their experiences on Lifeboat for Charles Chandler, author of It's Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock A Personal Biography, Walter Slezak said that Hitchcock xe2x80x9cknew more about how to help an actor than any director I ever worked withxe2x80x9d, and Hume Cronyn dismissed the idea that Hitchcock was not concerned with his actors as xe2x80x9cutterly fallaciousxe2x80x9d, describing at length the process of rehearsing and filming Lifeboat.Hitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers.In the 1980s, a new version of Alfred Hitchcock Presents was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions in a colourised form.In 1955 Hitchcock became a United States citizen.The Wrong Man (1957), Hitchcock's final film for Warner Bros., is a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of mistaken identity reported in Life magazine in 1953.Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work.According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.He was impressed with Murnau's work and later used many of his techniques for the set design in his own productions.<!--check this and rewrite: He would also have been affected by other foreign filmmakers whose work he absorbed as one of the earliest members of the London Film Society, formed in 1925.Hitchcock's luck changed with his first thriller, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), about the hunt for a serial killer who, wearing a black cloak and carrying a black bag, is murdering young blonde women in London, and only on Tuesdays. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He concluded that the analysis supported the Altaic grouping, although it was "older than most other language families in Eurasia, such as Indo-European or Finno-Ugric, and this is the reason why the modern Altaic languages preserve few common elements".In 1991 and again in 1996, Roy Miller defended the Altaic hypothesis and claimed that the criticisms of Clauson and Doerfer apply exclusively to the lexical correspondences, whereas the most pressing evidence for the theory is the similarities in verbal morphology.In 2003, Claus Schxc3xb6nig published a critical overview of the history of the Altaic hypothesis up to that time, siding with the earlier criticisms of Clauson, Doerfer, and Shcherbak.In 2003, Starostin, Anna Dybo and Oleg Mudrak published the Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages, which expanded the 1991 lexical lists and added other phonological and grammatical arguments.Starostin's book was criticized by Stefan Georg in 2004 and 2005,Other defenses of the theory, in response to the criticisms of Georg and Vovin, were published by Starostin in 2005,In 2010, Lars Johanson echoed Miller's 1996 rebuttal to the critics, and called for a muting of the polemic.The list below comprises linguists who have worked specifically on the Altaic problem since the publication of the first volume of Ramstedt's Einfxc3xbchrung in 1952.They reasoned that, if all three families had a common ancestor, we should expect losses to happen at random, and not only at the geographical margins of the family; and that the observed pattern is consistent with borrowing.According to C. Schxc3xb6nig (2003), after accounting for areal effects, the shared lexicon that could have a common genetic origin was reduced to a small number of monosyllabic lexical roots, including the personal pronouns and a few other deictic and auxiliary items, whose sharing could be explained in other ways; not the kind of sharing expected in cases of genetic relationship.Instead of a common genetic origin, Clauson, Doerfer, and Shcherbak proposed (in 1956-1966) that Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages form a Sprachbund: a set of languages with similarities due to convergence through intensive borrowing and long contact, rather than common origin.Asya Pereltsvaig further observed in 2011 that, in general, genetically related languages and families tend to diverge over time: the earlier forms are more similar than modern forms.It is followed by the Nihon shoki, completed in 720, and then by the Man'yxc5x8dshxc5xab, which dates from c. 771xe2x80x93785, but includes material that is from about 400 years earlier.The most important text for the study of early Korean is the Hyangga, a collection of 25 poems, of which some go back to the Three Kingdoms period (57 BCxe2x80x93668 AD), but are preserved in an orthography that only goes back to the 9th century AD.A proposed grouping of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic languages was published in 1730 by Philip Johan von Strahlenberg, a Swedish officer who traveled in the eastern Russian Empire while a prisoner of war after the Great Northern War.In 1844, the Finnish philologist Matthias Castrxc3xa9n proposed a broader grouping, that later came to be called the Uralxe2x80x93Altaic family, which included Turkic, Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus (=Tungusic) as an "Altaic" branch, and also the Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic languages as the "Uralic" branch (though Castrxc3xa9n himself used the terms "Tataric" and "Chudic"). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Instead they decided for pragmatic reasons to adopt the already standardized chancellery language of Saxony (Sxc3xa4chsische Kanzleisprache or Meixc3x9fner Kanzleideutsch), which was based on the administrative language of the non-Austrian area of Meixc3x9fen and Dresden.Thus Standard Austrian German has the same geographic origin as the German Standard German (Bundesdeutsches Hochdeutsch) and Swiss High German (Schweizer Hochdeutsch, not to be confused with the Alemannic Swiss German dialects).The process of introducing the new written standard was led by Joseph von Sonnenfels.Since 1951 the standardized form of Austrian German for official texts and schools has been defined by the Austrian Dictionary (), published under the authority of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture.As German is a pluricentric language, Austrian German is one among several varieties of Standard German.In all-caps words, capital xe1xbax9e (instead of SS) became standard in both nations in 2017, but SS remains valid.Because of the German language's pluricentric nature, German dialects in Austria should not be confused with the variety of Standard German spoken by most Austrians, which is distinct from that of Germany or Switzerland.Distinctions in vocabulary persist, for example, in culinary terms, where communication with Germans is frequently difficult, and administrative and legal language, which is due to Austria's exclusion from the development of a German nation-state in the late 19th century and its manifold particular traditions. </my-abstract>

<title>Axiom of choice</title>
<wiki-abstract> In mathematics, the axiom of choice, or AC, is an axiom of set theory equivalent to the statement that a Cartesian product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin, even if the collection is infinite. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The axiom of choice states that if for each x of type &sigma; there exists a y of type &tau; such that R(x,y), then there is a function f from objects of type &sigma; to objects of type &tau; such that R(x,f(x)) holds for all x of type &sigma;:(forall x^sigma)(exists y^tau) R(x,y) to (exists f^{sigma to tau})(forall x^sigma) R(x,f(x)).Unlike in set theory, the axiom of choice in type theory is typically stated as an axiom scheme, in which R varies over all formulas or over all formulas of a particular logical form..</ref>}}This is a joke: although the three are all mathematically equivalent, many mathematicians find the axiom of choice to be intuitive, the well-ordering principle to be counterintuitive, and Zorn's lemma to be too complex for any intuition..The debate is interesting enough, however, that it is considered of note when a theorem in ZFC (ZF plus AC) is logically equivalent (with just the ZF axioms) to the axiom of choice, and mathematicians look for results that require the axiom of choice to be false, though this type of deduction is less common than the type which requires the axiom of choice to be true.It is possible to prove many theorems using neither the axiom of choice nor its negation; such statements will be true in any model of ZF, regardless of the truth or falsity of the axiom of choice in that particular model.The status of the axiom of choice varies between different varieties of constructive mathematics.In Martin-Lxc3xb6f type theory and higher-order Heyting arithmetic, the appropriate statement of the axiom of choice is (depending on approach) included as an axiom or provable as a theorem.Per Martin-Lxc3xb6f, [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/Web/People/crary/819-f09/Martin-Lof80.pdf Intuitionistic type theory], 1980.Anne Sjerp Troelstra, Metamathematical investigation of intuitionistic arithmetic and analysis, Springer, 1973.</ref> Errett Bishop argued that the axiom of choice was constructively acceptable, sayingIn constructive set theory, however, Diaconescu's theorem shows that the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle (unlike in Martin-Lxc3xb6f type theory, where it does not). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Der Spiegel commented on November 6, 1948, that the Sword of Attila was hanging menacingly over Austria.American writer Cecelia Holland wrote The Death of Attila (1973), a historical novel in which Attila appears as a powerful background figure whose life and death deeply impact the protagonists, a young Hunnic warrior and a Germanic one.The name has many variants in several languages: Atli and Atle in Old Norse; Etzel in Middle High German (Nibelungenlied); xc3x86tla in Old English; Attila, Atilla, and Etele in Hungarian (Attila is the most popular); Attila, Atilla, Atilay, or Atila in Turkish; and Adil and Edil in Kazakh or Adil ("same/similar") or Edil ("to use") in Mongolian.In modern Hungary and in Turkey, "Attila" and its Turkish variation "Atilla" are commonly used as a male first name.When the Turkish Armed Forces invaded Cyprus in 1974, the operations were named after Attila ("The Attila Plan").The 1954 Universal International film Sign of the Pagan starred Jack Palance as Attila.File:AttilatheHun.jpg|Attila the HunFile:Atli.jpg|Attila the Hun in an illustration in the Poetic EddaFile:Brogi, Carlo (1850-1925) - n. 8227 - Certosa di Pavia - Medaglione sullo zoccolo della facciata.jpg|A nineteenth-century depiction of Attila.The Latin inscription tells that this is Attila, the scourge of God.File:Ritratto di Attila.jpg|Image of AttilaFile:Alessandro Algardi Meeting of Leo I and Attila 01.jpg|The Meeting of Leo& I<br />and Attila<br />by& Alessandro& Algardi<br />(1646xe2x80x931653)ALL REFERENCES are listed here in alphabetical order so as to avoid cluttering up the text of the article.Use  to insert a note in the text to the citation.Use  to specify a page number.The Huns had become a great power by the time that Attila came of age during the reign of his uncle Ruga, to the point that Nestorius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, deplored the situation with these words: "They have become both masters and slaves of the Romans".The death of Rugila (also known as Rua or Ruga) in 434 left the sons of his brother Mundzuk, Attila and Bleda, in control of the united Hun tribes. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Black Sea outflow moves westward along the northern Aegean Sea, then flows southwards along the east coast of Greece.The physical oceanography of the Aegean Sea is controlled mainly by the regional climate, the fresh water discharge from major rivers draining southeastern Europe, and the seasonal variations in the Black Sea surface water outflow through the Dardanelles Strait.Analysis of the Aegean during 1991 and 1992 revealed three distinct water masses:The climate of the Aegean Sea largely reflects the climate of Greece and Western Turkey, which is to say, predominately Mediterranean.Several seas are contained within the Aegean Sea; the Thracian Sea is a section of the Aegean located to the north, the Icarian Sea to the east, the Myrtoan Sea to the west, while the Sea of Crete is the southern section.The Greek regions that border the sea, in alphabetical order, are Attica, Central Greece, Central Macedonia, Crete, Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, North Aegean, Peloponnese, South Aegean, and Thessaly.In the north of the Aegean Sea, the climate is instead classified as Cold semi-arid (BSk), which feature cooler summers than Hot-summer Mediterranean climates.The Etesian winds are a dominant weather influence in the Aegean Basin.The below table lists climate conditions of some major Aegean cities:Numerous Greek and Turkish settlements are located along their mainland coast, as well as on towns on the Aegean islands. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The teenage protagonist, Alex, narrates his violent exploits and his experiences with state authorities intent on reforming him.In 2005, A Clockwork Orange was included on Time magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, In the introduction to the updated American text (these newer editions include the missing 21st chapter), Burgess explains that when he first brought the book to an American publisher, he was told that U.S. audiences would never go for the final chapter, in which Alex sees the error of his ways, decides he has lost his taste for violence and resolves to turn his life around.At the American publisher's insistence, Burgess allowed their editors to cut the redeeming final chapter from the U.S. version, so that the tale would end on a darker note, with Alex becoming his old, ultraviolent self again xe2x80x93 an ending which the publisher insisted would be "more realistic" and appealing to a US audience. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the town of Durgerdam, may not be considered part of Amsterdam.Statistics Netherlands uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam, not to be confused with Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam, a synonym of Groot Amsterdam), Greater Amsterdam (Groot Amsterdam, a COROP region) and the urban region Amsterdam (Stadsgewest Amsterdam).In May 2010, under a major reform, the number of Amsterdam boroughs was reduced to eight: Amsterdam-Centrum covering the city centre including the canal belt, Amsterdam-Noord consisting of the neighbourhoods north of the IJ lake, Amsterdam-Oost in the east, Amsterdam-Zuid in the south, Amsterdam-West in the west, Amsterdam Nieuw-West in the far west, Amsterdam Zuidoost in the southeast, and Westpoort covering the Port of Amsterdam area.On 18 September 2017, it was announced by Eberhard van der Laan in an open letter to Amsterdam citizens that Kajsa Ollongren would take up his office as acting Mayor of Amsterdam with immediate effect due to ill health.The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.Schools for foreign nationals in Amsterdam include the Amsterdam International Community School, British School of Amsterdam, Albert Einstein International School Amsterdam, Lycxc3xa9e Vincent van Gogh La Haye-Amsterdam primary campus (French school), International School of Amsterdam, and the Japanese School of Amsterdam.Amsterdam is a prominent centre for national and international media.Sloten, annexed in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam; is the oldest part of the city, dating to the 9th century.Amsterdam's main attractions include its historic canals, the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk Museum, Hermitage Amsterdam, the Concertgebouw, the Anne Frank House, the Scheepvaartmuseum, the Amsterdam Museum, the Heineken Experience, the Royal Palace of Amsterdam, Natura Artis Magistra, Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam, NEMO, the red-light district and many cannabis coffee shops.International coach services are provided by Eurolines from Amsterdam Amstel railway station, IDBUS from Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station, and Megabus from the Zuiderzeeweg in the east of the city.In order to facilitate easier transport to the center of Amsterdam, the city has various P+R Locations where people can park their car at an affordable price and transfer to one of the numerous public transport lines.Amsterdam was intended in 1932 to be the hub, a kind of Kilometre Zero, of the highway system of the Netherlands, Besides the A1, A2, A4 and A8, several freeways, such as the A7 and A6, carry traffic mainly bound for Amsterdam.The A10 ringroad surrounding the city connects Amsterdam with the Dutch national network of freeways.The Reguliersdwarsstraat is the main street for the LGBT community and nightlife. In 2008, there were 140 festivals and events in Amsterdam.Famous festivals and events in Amsterdam include: Koningsdag (which was named Koninginnedag until the crowning of King Willem-Alexander in 2013) (King's Day xe2x80x93 Queen's Day); the Holland Festival for the performing arts; the yearly Prinsengrachtconcert (classical concerto on the Prinsen canal) in August; the 'Stille Omgang' (a silent Roman Catholic evening procession held every March); Amsterdam Gay Pride; The Cannabis Cup; and the Uitmarkt. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This plant became operative in 2016 and produces the second generation Q5.From 2002 up to 2003, Audi headed the Audi Brand Group, a subdivision of the Volkswagen Group's Automotive Division consisting of Audi, Lamborghini and SEAT, that was focused on sporty values, with the marques' product vehicles and performance being under the higher responsibility of the Audi brand.In January 2014, Audi, along with the Wireless Power Consortium, operated a booth which demonstrated a phone compartment using the Qi open interface standard at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).In 2015, Audi admitted that at least 2.1 million Audi cars had been involved in the Volkswagen emissions testing scandal in which software installed in the cars manipulated emissions data to fool regulators and allow the cars to pollute at higher than government-mandated levels.The Audi emblem symbolises the amalgamation of Audi with DKW, Horch and Wanderer: the first ring from the left represents Audi, the second represents DKW, third is Horch, and the fourth and last ring Wanderer.The design is popularly believed to have been the idea of Klaus von Oertzen, the director of sales at Wanderer xe2x80x93 when Berlin was chosen as the host city for the 1936 Summer Olympics and that a form of the Olympic logo symbolized the newly established Auto Union's desire to succeed.The original "Audi" script, with the distinctive slanted tails on the "A" and "d" was created for the historic Audi company in 1920 by the famous graphic designer Lucian Bernhard, and was resurrected when Volkswagen revived the brand in 1965.Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.By 1991, Audi had the four-cylinder Audi 80, the 5-cylinder Audi 90 and Audi 100, the turbocharged Audi 200 and the Audi V8.The Neckarsulm factory is also home of the "quattro GmbH" (from November 2016 "Audi Sport GmbH"), a subsidiary responsible for development and production of Audi high-performance models: the R8 and the RS model range.The new merged company was incorporated on 1 January 1969 and was known as Audi NSU Auto Union AG, with its headquarters at NSU's Neckarsulm plant, and saw the emergence of Audi as a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era.The Audi A2, Audi TT and Audi R8 also use Audi Space Frame designs.For most of its lineup (excluding the A3, A1, and TT models), Audi has not adopted the transverse engine layout which is typically found in economy cars (such as Peugeot and Citroxc3xabn), since that would limit the type and power of engines that can be installed.The driving tour featured a fleet of 23 Audi TDI vehicles from 4 models (Audi Q7 3.0 TDI, Audi Q5 3.0 TDI, Audi A4 3.0 TDI, Audi A3 Sportback 2.0 TDI with S tronic transmission) travelling across the American continent from New York to Los Angeles, passing major cities like Chicago, Dallas and Las Vegas during the 13 daily stages, as well as natural wonders including the Rocky Mountains, Death Valley and the Grand Canyon., each with different levels of size and performance. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It can cruise at 500& mph.The largest military airplanes are the Ukrainian/Russian Antonov An-124 Ruslan (world's second-largest airplane, also used as a civilian transport), The 8-engine, piston/propeller Hughes H-4 Hercules "Spruce Goose"& xe2x80x94 an American World War II wooden flying boat transport with a greater wingspan (94 meters / 260 feet) than any current aircraft and a tail height equal to the tallest (Airbus A380-800 at 24.1 meters / 78 feet)& xe2x80x94 flew only one short hop in the late 1940s and never flew out of ground effect.The largest civilian airplanes, apart from the above-noted An-225 and An-124, are the Airbus Beluga cargo transport derivative of the Airbus A300 jet airliner, the Boeing Dreamlifter cargo transport derivative of the Boeing 747 jet airliner/transport (the 747-200B was, at its creation in the 1960s, the heaviest aircraft ever built, with a maximum weight of 836,000 pounds (over 400 tons)),The fastest recorded powered aircraft flight and fastest recorded aircraft flight of an air-breathing powered aircraft was of the NASA X-43A Pegasus, a scramjet-powered, hypersonic, lifting body experimental research aircraft, at Mach 9.6 (nearly 7,000& mph).They are also relatively noisy compared to other forms of travel and high altitude aircraft generate contrails, which experimental evidence suggests may alter weather patterns.Aircraft are produced in several different types optimized for various uses; military aircraft, which includes not just combat types but many types of supporting aircraft, and civil aircraft, which include all non-military types, experimental and model.A military aircraft is any aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type.Tiltrotor aircraft (such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey), tiltwing, tail-sitter, and coleopter aircraft have their rotors/propellers horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight.The smallest aircraft are toys/recreational items, and even smaller, nano-aircraft.The largest aircraft by dimensions and volume (as of 2016) is the 302-foot-long (about 95 meters) British Airlander 10, a hybrid blimp, with helicopter and fixed-wing features, and reportedly capable of speeds up to 90& mph (about 150& km/h), and an airborne endurance of two weeks with a payload of up to 22,050 pounds (11 tons).The largest aircraft by weight and largest regular fixed-wing aircraft ever built, , is the Antonov An-225 Mriya.The fixed parts of the structure comprise the airframe.The avionics comprise the aircraft flight control systems and related equipment, including the cockpit instrumentation, navigation, radar, monitoring, and communications systems.The flight envelope of an aircraft refers to its approved design capabilities in terms of airspeed, load factor and altitude.The range is the distance an aircraft can fly between takeoff and landing, as limited by the time it can remain airborne.For a powered aircraft the time limit is determined by the fuel load and rate of consumption.For an unpowered aircraft, the maximum flight time is limited by factors such as weather conditions and pilot endurance.Other types, such as gliders and balloons, have also been used as military aircraft; for example, balloons were used for observation during the American Civil War and World War I, and military gliders were used during World War II to land troops.Civil aircraft divide into commercial and general types, however there are some overlaps.Commercial aircraft include types designed for scheduled and charter airline flights, carrying passengers, mail and other cargo. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, as he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.In 1870, 23-year-old Bell travelled with his parents and his brother's widow, Caroline Margaret Ottaway, to Paris, Ontario, to stay with Thomas Henderson, a Baptist minister and family friend.|group=N}}At the homestead, Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his "dreaming place",After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on Helmholtz's work with electricity and sound.Bell's patent covered "the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound" Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design.Meucci's testimony in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions, as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph (ADT) of New York, which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union in 1901.The value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world, and patent applications were made in most major countries, but when Bell delayed the German patent application, the electrical firm of Siemens & Halske (S&H) set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent.In his final, and some of his most productive years, Bell split his residency between Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and Beinn Bhreagh, where they spent increasing amounts of time.Until the end of his life, Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes, but Beinn Bhreagh would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, it is clear that the Anatolian languages, the earliest attested branch of Indo-European, have been spoken in Anatolia since at least the 19th century BC.The earliest historical records of Anatolia stem from the southeast of the region and are from the Mesopotamian-based Akkadian Empire during the reign of Sargon of Akkad in the 24th century BC.One of the numerous cuneiform records dated circa 20th century BC, found in Anatolia at the Assyrian colony of Kanesh, uses an advanced system of trading computations and credit lines.Unlike the Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in Mesopotamia, the Hittites were centered at Hattusa (modern Boxc4x9fazkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC.From the 9th century BC, Luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as Lydia, Caria and Lycia, all of which had Hellenic influence.From the 10th to late 7th centuries BC, much of Anatolia (particularly the southeastern regions) fell to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, including all of the Syro-Hittite states, Tabal, Kingdom of Commagene, the Cimmerians and Scythians and swathes of Cappadocia.The Neo-Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by Medes, Persians, Scythians and their own Babylonian relations. </my-abstract>

2017, Glassdoor said Apple was the 48th best place to work, having originally entered at rank 19 in 2009, peaking at rank 10 in 2012, and falling down the ranks in subsequent years.An editorial article in The Verge in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has "matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design" and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products.Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (5.6& million split-adjusted shares )Jobs was immediately convinced that all future

<my-abstract> The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.; Army of Northern VirginiaThe primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the Army of Northern Virginia.However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat.The Western theater refers to military operations between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, including the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee, as well as parts of Louisiana.; Army of the Tennessee and Army of the Cumberland The primary Union forces in the Western theater were the Army of the Tennessee and the Army of the Cumberland, named for the two rivers, the Tennessee River and Cumberland River.All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware.In Texas v. White,  the United States Supreme Court ruled that Texas had remained a state ever since it first joined the Union, despite claims that it joined the Confederate States; the court further held that the Constitution did not permit states to unilaterally secede from the United States, and that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were "absolutely null", under the constitution.The war had utterly devastated the South, and posed serious questions of how the South would be re-integrated to the Union.The war accounted for more American deaths than in all other U.S. wars combined.Based on 1860 census figures, 8 percent of all white men aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6 percent in the North and 18 percent in the South.Union army dead, amounting to 15 percent of the over two million who served, was broken down as follows:In addition there were 4,523 deaths in the Navy (2,112 in battle) and 460 in the Marines (148 in battle).Black troops made up 10 percent of the Union death toll, they amounted to 15 percent of disease deaths but less than 3 percent of those killed in battle.Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of logistical support and lack of infantry recruits for the Confederacy in that state.; Stones River Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans at the Battle of Stones River in Tennessee, the culmination of the Stones River Campaign.;Vicksburg Naval forces assisted Grant in the long, complex Vicksburg Campaign that resulted in the Confederates surrendering at the Battle of Vicksburg in July 1863, which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the turning points of the war.;ChickamaugaThe one clear Confederate victory in the West was the Battle of Chickamauga.)</small>|alt=Painting of four men conferring in a ship's cabin, entitled "The Peacemakers".poly 486 710 579 672 663 739 687 863 649 936 579 965 739 1133 782 1037 800 956 910 905 905 1025 855 1305 576 1223 513 1371 620 1388 687 1467 846 1510 1010 2035 1160 2140 869 2135 718 1682 663 1685 634 2000 725 2030 489 2095 504 1800 362 1775 263 1710 225 1516 252 1226 269 1046 324 948 434 913 481 866 446 782 William Shermanpoly 1092 794 1182 823 1188 892 1162 970 1220 1023 1330 1179 1429 1153 1478 1223 1388 1498 1440 1548 1397 1568 1397 1788 1429 1826 1385 1867 1301 1838 1275 1571 1243 1533 1243 1478 1095 1492 985 1588 924 1133 970 1028 1046 991 1028 907 1034 837 Ulysses Grantpoly 1634 802 1715 770 1794 825 1800 950 1933 962 2194 1072 2188 1185 2116 1347 2029 1396 2032 1547 1669 1544 1740 1947 1527 1945 1579 1875 1620 1852 1599 1730 1565 1883 1394 1930 1408 1872 1454 1817 1559 1333 1568 1260 1599 1182 1672 980 1620 886 Abraham Lincolnpoly 2620 780 2740 775 2754 889 2745 991 2855 1064 2864 1316 2800 1420 2766 1516 2806 1600 2772 1942 2664 1919 2577 1791 2508 1780 2496 1719 2455 1745 2496 2052 2348 2145 2308 2128 2345 2038 2293 1759 2229 2081 1977 2076 1997 2035 2058 2009 2093 1965 2174 1537 2461 1429 2453 1290 2357 1382 2287 1336 2290 1287 2354 1203 2412 1179 2499 1133 2540 1072 2560 988 2595 837 David PorterMeanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals Joseph E. Johnston and John Bell Hood along the way.b'      DESCRIPTION: Internal war in the United States over slavery.{ }The American Civil War (also known by other names) was a civil war in the United States from 1861 to 1865, fought between northern states loyal to the Union and southern states that had seceded to form the Confederate States of America.This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.Deaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It is now regarded by some commentators as the greatest Japanese film ever made, and in 1979, a poll of Japanese film critics also voted it the best Japanese film ever made.Kurosawa's next project, Throne of Blood, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbethxe2x80x94set, like Seven Samurai, in the Sengoku Eraxe2x80x94represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into a Japanese context.While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he would never be able to film his stories.In 1977, American director George Lucas released Star Wars, a wildly successful science fiction film influenced by Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, among other works.b'      DESCRIPTION: Japanese film director and screenwriter.{ }Akira Kurosawa ( Kurosawa Akira; March 23, 1910 xe2x80x93 September 6, 1998) was a Japanese film director and screenwriter, who directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years.Kurosawa has commented on the lasting sense of loss he felt at his brother's death Only four months later, Kurosawa's eldest brother also died, leaving Akira, at age 23, the only one of the Kurosawa brothers still living, together with his three surviving sisters.In 1935, the new film studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L.Kurosawa's growing reputation among Western audiences in the 1950s would make Western audiences more sympathetic to the reception of later generations of Japanese filmmakers ranging from Kon Ichikawa, Masaki Kobayashi, Nagisa Oshima and Shohei Imamura to Juzo Itami, Takeshi Kitano and Takashi Miike.His career boosted by his sudden international fame, Kurosawa, now reunited with his original film studio, Toho (which would go on to produce his next 11 films), set to work on his next project, Ikiru. </my-abstract>

<title>Abjad</title>
<wiki-abstract> An abjad () is a type of writing system in which (in contrast to true alphabets) each symbol or glyph stands for a consonant, in effect leaving it to readers to infer or otherwise supply an appropriate vowel. The term is a neologism introduced in 1990 by Peter T. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> This made the script easy to learn, and seafaring Phoenician merchants took the script throughout the then-known world.The Phoenician abjad was a radical simplification of phonetic writing, since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick a hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically, much as man'yxc5x8dgana (Chinese characters used solely for phonetic use) was used to represent Japanese phonetically before the invention of kana.Phoenician gave rise to a number of new writing systems, including the widely used Aramaic abjad and the Greek alphabet. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The primary division is into North Indic scripts used in Northern India, Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan, and Southern Indic scripts used in South India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.South Indic letter forms are very rounded; North Indic less so, though Odia, Golmol and Litumol of Nepal script are rounded.Most North Indic scripts' full letters incorporate a horizontal line at the top, with Gujarati and Odia as exceptions; South Indic scripts do not.Indic scripts indicate vowels through dependent vowel signs (diacritics) around the consonants, often including a sign that explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel.In some languages, including Hindi, it becomes a final closing consonant at the end of a word, in this case k. The inherent vowel may be changed by adding vowel mark (diacritics), producing syllables such as xe0xa4x95xe0xa4xbf ki, xe0xa4x95xe0xa5x81 ku, xe0xa4x95xe0xa5x87 ke,  xe0xa4x95xe0xa5x8b ko.A 19th-century manuscript in the Devanagari scriptIn many of the Brahmic scripts, a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking, so a vowel marker like xe0xa4xbf -i, falling before the character it modifies, may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced.The Brahmic and Ethiopic families are thought to have originated from the Semitic abjads by the addition of vowel marks.The Arabic scripts used for Kurdish in Iraq and for Uyghur in Xinjiang, China, as well as the Hebrew script of Yiddish, are fully vowelled, but because the vowels are written with full letters rather than diacritics (with the exception of distinguishing between /a/ and /o/ in the latter) and there are no inherent vowels, these are considered alphabets, not abugidas.The imperial Mongol script called Phagspa was derived from the Tibetan abugida, but all vowels are written in-line rather than as diacritics. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> With sales of 30 million, The enormous interest in the ABBA Gold: Greatest Hits compilation saw the release of More ABBA Gold: More ABBA Hits in 1993.In 1994, two Australian cult films caught the attention of the world's media, both focusing on admiration for ABBA: The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Muriel's Wedding."The same year the members of ABBA went their separate ways, the French production of a "tribute" show (a children's TV musical named Abbacadabra using 14 ABBA songs) spawned new interest in the group's music.After receiving little attention during the mid-to-late-1980s, ABBA's music experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s due to the UK synth-pop duo Erasure, who released Abba-esque, a four track extended play release featuring cover versions of ABBA songs which topped several European charts in 1992.Despite a number of requests from fans, Ulvaeus and Andersson are still refusing to release ABBA's version of "Just Like That" in its entirety, even though the complete version has surfaced on bootlegs.The group travelled to London to promote The Singles: The First Ten Years in the first week of November 1982, appearing on Saturday Superstore and The Late, Late Breakfast Show, and also to West Germany in the second week, to perform on Show Express.Andersson released his third album BAO 3 in October 2007, of new material with his band BAO and vocalists Helen Sjxc3xb6holm and Tommy Kxc3xb6rberg, as well as playing to full houses at two of Sweden's largest concert venues in October and November 2007, with an audience of 14,000. Ulvaeus has not appeared on stage performing music since ABBA, but had a reunion with his co-members of the Hootenanny Singers on 16 July 2005 at a music festival in his hometown of Vxc3xa4stervik, singing their 1966 hit "Marianne".Andersson and Ulvaeus have been highly involved in the worldwide productions of the musical Mamma Mia!, alongside Lyngstad who attends premieres.The album, which featured other guest vocalists, reached number 17 in Sweden.In 2018, Lyngstad and multi-Grammy winning Jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval released a reworking of the ABBA song "Andante, Andante" as a single, which is also featured on Sandoval's album Ultimate Duets.ABBA were perfectionists in the studio, working on tracks until they got them right rather than leaving them to come back to later on.The band created a basic rhythm track with a drummer, guitarist and bass player, and overlaid other arrangements and instruments.The single "Pxc3xa5 Sxc3xb6ndag" ("On Sunday") received significant airplay on Swedish radio and even made the Swedish Top 10, unique for a song made for kids to enjoy.Also in 1987, Fxc3xa4ltskog released her third English-language solo album, the Peter Cetera-produced I Stand Alone, which also included the Billboard Adult Contemporary duet with Cetera, "I Wasn't the One (Who Said Goodbye)", as well as the European charting singles "The Last Time" and "Let It Shine".It featured all new cover versions: notable tracks were by Madness ("Money, Money, Money"), Culture Club ("Voulez-Vous"), the Corrs ("The Winner Takes It All"), Steps ("Lay All Your Love on Me", "I Know Him So Well"), and a medley entitled "Thank ABBA for the Music" performed by several artists and as featured on the Brits Awards that same year.In 1997, an ABBA tribute group was formed, the ABBA Teens, which was subsequently renamed the A-Teens to allow the group some independence. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Loyalty requires affection also to the office of the Sovereign, attachment to royalty, attachment to the law and to the constitution of the realm, and he who would, by force or by fraud, endeavour to prostrate that law and constitution, though he may retain his affection for its head, can boast but an imperfect and spurious species of loyalty (R v O'Connell (1844) 7 ILR 261).There were four kinds of allegiances (Rittson v Stordy (1855) 3 Sm & G 230; De Geer v Stone (1882) 22 Ch D 243; Isaacson v Durant (1886) 54 LT 684; Gibson, Gavin v Gibson [1913] 3 KB 379; Joyce v DPP [1946] AC 347; Collingwood v Pace (1661) O Bridg 410; Lane v Bennett (1836) 1 M & W 70; Lyons Corp v East India Co (1836) 1 Moo PCC 175; Birtwhistle v Vardill (1840) 7 Cl & Fin 895; R v Lopez, R v Sattler (1858) Dears & B 525; Ex p Brown (1864) 5 B & S 280);(a) Ligeantia naturalis, absoluta, pura et indefinita, and this originally is due by nature and birthright, and is called alta ligeantia, and those that owe this are called subditus natus;(b) Ligeantia acquisita, not by nature but by acquisition or denization, being called a denizen, or rather denizon, because they are subditus datus;(c) Ligeantia localis, by operation of law, when a friendly alien enters the country, because so long as they are in the country they are within the Sovereign's protection, therefore they owe the Sovereign a local obedience or allegiance (R v Cowle (1759) 2 Burr 834; Low v Routledge (1865) 1 Ch App 42; Re Johnson, Roberts v Attorney-General [1903] 1 Ch 821; Tingley v Muller [1917] 2 Ch 144; Rodriguez v Speyer [1919] AC 59; Johnstone v Pedlar [1921] 2 AC 262; R v Tucker (1694) Show Parl Cas 186; R v Keyn (1876) 2 Ex  D 63; Re Stepney Election Petn, Isaacson v Durant (1886) 17 QBD 54);(d) A legal obedience, where a particular law requires the taking of an oath of allegiance by subject or alien alike.Natural allegiance was acquired by birth within the Sovereign's dominions (except for the issue of diplomats or of invading forces or of an alien in an enemy occupied territory).An alien, coming into a colony also became, temporarily a subject of the Crown, and acquired rights both within and beyond the colony, and these latter rights could not be affected by the laws of that colony (Routledge v Low (1868) LR 3 HL 100; 37 LJ Ch 454; 18 LT 874; 16 WR 1081, HL; Reid v Maxwell (1886) 2 TLR 790; Falcon v Famous Players Film Co [1926] 2 KB 474).A resident alien owed allegiance even when the protection of the Crown was withdrawn owing to the occupation of an enemy, because the absence of the Crown's protection was temporary and involuntary (de Jager v Attorney-General of Natal [1907] AC 326).Legal allegiance was due when an alien took an oath of allegiance required for a particular office under the Crown.By the Naturalisation Act 1870, it was made possible for British subjects to renounce their nationality and allegiance, and the ways in which that nationality is lost are defined. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> 6, February 1974.Dick also defended van Vogt against Damon Knight's criticisms:In a review of Transfinite: The Essential A. E. van Vogt, science fiction writer Paul Di Filippo said:In The John W. Campbell Letters, Campbell says, "The son-of-a-gun gets hold of you in the first paragraph, ties a knot around you, and keeps it tied in every paragraph thereafterxe2x80x94including the ultimate last one".Harlan Ellison (who had begun reading van Vogt as a teenager) wrote, "Van was the first writer to shine light on the restricted ways in which I had been taught to view the universe and the human condition".Writing in 1984, David Hartwell said:The literary critic Leslie A. Fiedler said something similar:American literary critic Fredric Jameson says of van Vogt:}}Van Vogt still has his critics.For example, Darrell Schweitzer writing to The New York Review of Science Fiction in 1999 quoted a passage from the original van Vogt novelette "The Mixed Men", which he was then reading, and remarked:The Science Fiction Writers of America named him its 14th Grand Master in 1995 (presented 1996).In 1946, van Vogt and his first wife, Edna Mayne Hull, were Guests of Honor at the fourth World Science Fiction Convention.In 1980, van Vogt received a "Casper Award" (precursor to the Canadian Prix Aurora Awards) for Lifetime Achievement.The Science Fiction Writers of America named him its 14th Grand Master in 1995 (presented 1996).).Writing an obituary of van Vogt, Robert J. Sawyer, a fellow Canadian writer of science fiction, remarked:It is generally held that the "damnable SFWA politics" concerns Damon Knight, the founder of the SFWA, who abhorred van Vogt's style and politics and thoroughly demolished his literary reputation in the 1950s.Harlan Ellison was more explicit in 1999 introduction to Futures Past: The Best Short Fiction of A. E. van Vogt: As they say during sweeps week on television: coincidence or conspiracy?}}In 1996, van Vogt received a Special Award from the World Science Fiction Convention "for six decades of golden age science fiction".The works of van Vogt were translated into French by the surrealist Boris Vian (The World of Null-A as Le Monde des xc3x85 in 1958), and van Vogt's works were "viewed as great literature of the surrealist school".Also: .}}}} (ISFDB). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Studies investigating arsenic as an epigenetic factor can be used to develop precise biomarkers of exposure and susceptibility.The Chinese brake fern (Pteris vittata) hyperaccumulates arsenic from the soil into its leaves and has a proposed use in phytoremediation.During the Victorian era, arsenic was widely used in home decor, especially wallpapers.Extensive arsenic contamination of groundwater has led to widespread arsenic poisoning in BangladeshSome Canadians are drinking water that contains inorganic arsenic.An illustrative mineral is arsenopyrite<!--, also unofficially called mispickel,In 2014, China was the top producer of white arsenic with almost 70% world share, followed by Morocco, Russia, and Belgium, according to the British Geological Survey and the United States Geological Survey.On roasting arsenopyrite in air, arsenic sublimes as arsenic(III) oxide leaving iron oxides,The word arsenic has its origin in the Syriac word  (al) zarniqa,The isolation of arsenic was described by Jabir ibn Hayyan before 815 AD.In particular, iron as a coagulant was found to remove arsenic with an efficacy exceeding 90%.Magnetic separations of arsenic at very low magnetic field gradients with high-surface-area and monodisperse magnetite (Fe nanocrystals, the mass of waste associated with arsenic removal from water has been dramatically reduced.Chaff-based filters have recently been shown to reduce the arsenic content of water to 3& xc2xb5g/L.Typical background concentrations of arsenic do not exceed 3& ng/m<sup>3</sup> in the atmosphere; 100& mg/kg in soil; and 10& xcexbcg/L in freshwater.Minerals with the formula MAsS and MAs (M = Fe, Ni, Co) are the dominant commercial sources of arsenic, together with realgar (an arsenic sulfide mineral) and native (elemental) arsenic."During the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, a number of arsenic compounds were used as medicines, including arsphenamine (by Paul Ehrlich) and arsenic trioxide (by Thomas Fowler).Arsenic trioxide has been used in a variety of ways over the past 500 years, most commonly in the treatment of cancer, but also in medications as diverse as Fowler's solution in psoriasis.In subtoxic doses, soluble arsenic compounds act as stimulants, and were once popular in small doses as medicine by people in the mid-18th to 19th centuries. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07& & fm, where A is the total number of nucleons.The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickelxe2x80x94a total nucleon number of about 60xe2x80x94is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together.The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force.Only such an intense concentration of charge could produce an electric field strong enough to deflect the alpha particles as observed.While experimenting with the products of radioactive decay, in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table.In 1913 the physicist Niels Bohr proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon.Later in the same year Henry Moseley provided additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory.For example, if a single photon strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon; see Electron properties.The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its frequency, so these specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level.If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively xe2x80x93 such atoms are called ions.The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force.Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Electron emission techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), which measure the binding energies of the core electrons, are used to identify the atomic species present in a sample in a non-destructive way. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> As aluminium is a small atom relative to these chalcogens, these have four-coordinate tetrahedral aluminium with various polymorphs having structures related to wurtzite, with two-thirds of the possible metal sites occupied either in an orderly (xcexb1) or random (xcexb2) fashion; the sulfide also has a xcexb3 form related to xcexb3-alumina, and an unusual high-temperature hexagonal form where half the aluminium atoms have tetrahedral four-coordination and the other half have trigonal bipyramidal five-coordination.Four pnictides xe2x80x93 aluminium nitride (AlN), aluminium phosphide (AlP), aluminium arsenide (AlAs), and aluminium antimonide (AlSb) xe2x80x93 are known.Aluminium in the air is washed out by the rain or normally settles down but small particles of aluminium remain in the air for a long time.Acidic precipitation is the main natural factor to mobilize aluminium from natural sources however, the main factor of presence of aluminium in salt and freshwater are the industrial processes that also release aluminium into air.In water, aluminium acts as a toxixd1x81 agent on gill-breathing animals such as fish by causing loss of plasma- and hemolymph ions leading to osmoregulatory failure.Aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acidic soils.This allows aluminium to be used to store reagents such as nitric acid, concentrated sulfuric acid, and some organic acids.In hot concentrated hydrochloric acid, aluminium reacts with water with evolution of hydrogen, and in aqueous sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide at room temperature to form aluminatesxe2x80x94protective passivation under these conditions is negligible.Aluminium reacts with most nonmetals upon heating, forming compounds such as aluminium nitride (AlN), aluminium sulfide (Al).A final report into the incident in 2013 concluded it was unlikely that this had caused long-term health problems.Aluminium has been suspected of being a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease,Aluminium increases estrogen-related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory.Exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause pulmonary fibrosis.Consumption of antacids, antiperspirants, vaccines, and cosmetics provide possible routes of exposure.In case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium, the only treatment is deferoxamine mesylate which may be given to help eliminate aluminium from the body by chelation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> These provinces may take the form of national churches (such as in Canada, Uganda, or Japan) or a collection of nations (such as the West Indies, Central Africa, or Southeast Asia).In addition to the forty-one provinces, there are five extraprovincial churches under the metropolitical authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury.In addition to other member churches, the churches of the Anglican Communion are in full communion with the Old Catholic churches of the Union of Utrecht and the Scandinavian Lutheran churches of the Porvoo Communion in Europe, the India-based Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian and Malabar Independent Syrian churches and the Philippine Independent Church, also known as the Aglipayan Church.The Anglican Communion traces much of its growth to the older mission organisations of the Church of England such as the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (founded 1698), the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (founded 1701) and the Church Missionary Society (founded 1799). }}The Church of England was the established church not only in England, but in its trans-Oceanic colonies.Thus the only member churches of the present Anglican Communion existing by the mid-18th century were the Church of England, its closely linked sister church the Church of Ireland (which also separated from Roman Catholicism under Henry VIII) and the Scottish Episcopal Church which for parts of the 17th and 18th centuries was partially underground (it was suspected of Jacobite sympathies).The enormous expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries of the British Empire brought Anglicanism along with it. </my-abstract>

<title>Author</title>
<wiki-abstract> An author is the creator or originator of any written work such as a book or play, and is also considered a writer. More broadly defined, an author is "the person who originated or gave existence to anything" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> There are three principal areas covered by editors xe2x80x93 Proofing (checking the Grammar and spelling, looking for typing errors), Story (potentially an area of deep angst for both author and publisher), and Layout (the setting of the final proof ready for publishing often requires minor text changes so a layout editor is required to ensure that these do not alter the sense of the text).Pierre Bourdieu's essay "The Field of Cultural Production" depicts the publishing industry as a "space of literary or artistic position-takings", also called the "field of struggles", which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field.According to the studies of James Curran, the system of shared values among editors in Britain has generated a pressure among authors to write to fit the editors' expectations, removing the focus from the reader-audience and putting a strain on the relationship between authors and editors and on writing as a social act. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> They differ from transient fear or anxiety, often stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months or more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children.Anxiety is distinguished from fear, which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat.Joseph E. LeDoux and Lisa Feldman Barrett have both sought to separate automatic threat responses from additional associated cognitive activity within anxiety.Anxiety can be experienced with long, drawn-out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life, known as chronic (or generalized) anxiety, or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic, stressful panic attacks, known as acute anxiety.The physiological symptoms of anxiety may include:There are various types of anxiety.That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences.Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for anxiety disorders and is a first line treatment.In the central nervous system (CNS), the major mediators of the symptoms of anxiety disorders appear to be norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). </my-abstract>

M. Barrie) on both sides of the Atlantic; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in The Red House Mystery (although this was severely criticised by Raymond Chandler for the implausibility of its plot in his essay The Simple Art of Murder in the eponymous collection that appeared in 1950)."In his literary home, Punch, where the When We Were Very Young verses had first appeared, Methuen continued to publish whatever Milne wrote, including the long poem "The Norman Church" and an assembly of articles entitled Year In, Year Out (which Milne likened to a benefit night for the author).In 1930, Milne adapted Kenneth Grahame's novel The Wind in the Willows for the stage as Toad of Toad Hall.Milne and his wife became estranged from their son, who came to resent what he saw as his father's exploitation of his childhood and came to hate the books that had thrust him into the public eye.The rights to A. </my-abstract>

<title>Axiom</title>
<wiki-abstract> An axiom or postulate is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. The word comes from the Greek axíōma (}}) 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident. </wiki-abstract>

 , 
A deductive system consists of a set <math>Lambda</math> of logical axioms, a set <math>Sigma</math> of non-logical axioms, and a set <math>{(Gamma, phi)}</math> of rules of inference.  A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be complete.  A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas <math>phi</math>,
that is, for any statement that is a logical consequence of <math>Sigma</math> there actually exists a deduction of the statement from <math>Sigma</math>.  This is sometimes expressed as "everything that is true is provable", but it must be understood that "true" here means "made true by the set of axioms", and not, for example, "true in the intended interpretation". Gödel's completeness theorem establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.
Note that "completeness" has a different meaning here than it does in the context of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, which states that no recursive, consistent set of non-logical axioms <math>Sigma</math> of the Theory of Arithmetic is complete, in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement <math>phi</math> such that neither <math>phi</math> nor <math>lnotphi</math> can be proved from the given set of axioms.
There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of completeness of a deductive system and on the other hand that of completeness of a set of non-logical axioms.  The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.
 , 
Early mathematicians regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of physical space, and obviously there could only be one such model. The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as Boolean algebra made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. Galois showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and modern algebra was born.  In the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

<my-abstract> Usually one takes as logical axioms at least some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all tautologies in the language; in the case of predicate logic more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove logical truths that are not tautologies in the strict sense.In propositional logic it is common to take as logical axioms all formulae of the following forms, where <math>phi</math>, <math>chi</math>, and <math>psi</math> can be any formulae of the language and where the included primitive connectives are only "<math>eg</math>" for negation of the immediately following proposition and "<math>to</math>" for implication from antecedent to consequent propositions:#<math>phi to (psi to phi)</math>#<math>(phi to (psi to chi)) to ((phi to psi) to (phi to chi))</math>#<math>(lnot phi to lnot psi) to (psi to phi).</math>Each of these patterns is an axiom schema, a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms.Given a formula <math>phi</math> in a first-order language <math>mathfrak{L}</math>, a variable <math>x</math> and a term <math>t</math> that is substitutable for <math>x</math> in <math>phi</math>, the formulais universally valid.Where the symbol <math>phi^x_t</math> stands for the formula <math>phi</math> with the term <math>t</math> substituted for <math>x</math>.(Sx = Sy to x = y) </math># <math>(phi(0) land forall x.,(phi(x) to phi(Sx))) to forall x.phi(x)</math> for any <math>mathfrak{L}_{NT}</math> formula <math>phi</math> with one free variable.The standard structure is <math>mathfrak{N} = langleN, 0, Srangle</math> where <math>N</math> is the set of natural numbers, <math>S</math> is the successor function and <math>0</math> is naturally interpreted as the number 0.Probably the oldest, and most famous, list of axioms are the 4 + 1 Euclid's postulates of plane geometry.Given a formula <math>phi</math> in a first-order language <math>mathfrak{L}</math>, a variable <math>x</math> and a term <math>t</math> that is substitutable for <math>x</math> in <math>phi</math>, the formulais universally valid.Non-logical axioms are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Martin Kitchen, writing in Speer: Hitler's Architect, stated that much of the increase in Germany's arms production was actually due to systems instituted by Speer's predecessor (Fritz Todt) and furthermore that Speer was intimately involved in the "Final Solution".Speer was born in Mannheim, into an upper-middle-class family.Speer was indicted on four counts: participating in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of crime against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace; war crimes; and crimes against humanity.The chief United States prosecutor, Robert H. Jackson, of the U.S. Supreme Court said, "Speer joined in planning and executing the program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into German war industries, which waxed in output while the workers waned in starvation."Wolters and longtime Speer secretary Annemarie Kempf, while not permitted direct communication with Speer in Spandau did what they could to help his family and carry out the requests Speer put in letters to his wifexe2x80x94the only written communication he was officially allowed.When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler took office in January& 1933.The organizers of the 1933 Nuremberg Rally asked Speer to submit designs for the rally, bringing him into contact with Hitler for the first time. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> An axon (from Greek ἄξων áxōn, axis), or nerve fiber (or nerve fibre: see spelling differences), is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, in vertebrates, that typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials away from the nerve cell body. The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles, and glands. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The largest of these is the corpus callosum that connects the two cerebral hemispheres, and this has around 20 million axons.The structure of a neuron is seen to consist of two separate functional regions, or compartments xe2x80x93 the cell body together with the dendrites as one region, and the axonal region as the other.The axonal region or compartment, includes the axon hillock, the initial segment, the rest of the axon, and the axon telodendria, and axon terminals.Sometimes the axon of a neuron may synapse onto dendrites of the same neuron, when it is known as an autapse.Most axons carry signals in the form of action potentials, which are discrete electrochemical impulses that travel rapidly along an axon, starting at the cell body and terminating at points where the axon makes synaptic contact with target cells.Studies on the axoplasm has shown the movement of numerous vesicles of all sizes to be seen along cytoskeletal filaments xe2x80x93 the microtubules, and neurofilaments, in both directions between the axon and its terminals and the cell body.Outgoing anterograde transport from the cell body along the axon, carries mitochondria and membrane proteins needed for growth to the axon terminal. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> By contrast, the cursive developed out of the Nabataean alphabet in the same period soon became the standard for writing Arabic, evolving into the Arabic alphabet as it stood by the time of the early spread of Islam.The development of cursive versions of Aramaic also led to the creation of the Syriac, Palmyrene and Mandaic alphabets, which formed the basis of the historical scripts of Central Asia, such as the Sogdian and Mongolian alphabets.The Old Turkic script is generally considered to have its ultimate origins in Aramaic, as suggested by V. Thomsen, or possibly via Kharosthi (cf., Issyk inscription).Aramaic is also considered to be the most likely source of the Brahmi script, ancestor of the Brahmic family of scripts, which includes Devanagari.Today, Biblical Aramaic, Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialects and the Aramaic language of the Talmud are written in the modern-Hebrew alphabet (distinguished from the Old Hebrew script). </my-abstract>

<title>American shot</title>
<wiki-abstract> "American shot" is a translation of a phrase from French film criticism, plan américain, and refers to a medium-long ("knee") film shot of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> It's actually the closest you can get to an actor while keeping both his face and his holstered gun in frame.The French critics thought it was characteristic of American films of the 1930s or 1940s; however, it was mostly characteristic of cheaper American movies, such as Charlie Chan mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.Howard Hawks legitimized this style in his films, allowing characters to act, even when not talking, when most of the audience would not be paying attention. </my-abstract>

<title>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis</title>
<wiki-abstract> Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the white matter. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> These are considered alternative therapies, used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.There is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separatelyIn a study of 16 children with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases -with ADAM and severe peripheral neuropathy- were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered.Residual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to ataxia and hemiparesis.Patients with demyelinating illnesses, such as MS, have shown cognitive deficits even when there is minimal physical disability.Another study compared nineteen children with a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls.The relationship between ADEM and anti-MOG associated encephalomyelitis is currently under research. </my-abstract>

<title>Ataxia</title>
<wiki-abstract> Ataxia is a neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that can include gait abnormality, speech changes, and abnormalities in eye movements. Ataxia is a clinical manifestation indicating dysfunction of the parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement, such as the cerebellum. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging.Any type of focal lesion of the central nervous system (such as stroke, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory [such as sarcoidosis], and "chronic lymphocytyc inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids syndrome" [CLIPPERS]) will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion: cerebellar if in the cerebellum; sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord...to include cord compression by thickened ligamentum flavum or stenosis of the boney spinal canal...(and rarely in the thalamus or parietal lobe); or vestibular if in the vestibular system (including the vestibular areas of the cerebral cortex).Exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function.most antiepileptic drugs have cerebellar ataxia as a possible adverse effect), Lithium level over 1.5mEq/L, synthetic cannabinoid HU-211 ingestionNon-hereditary causes of cerebellar degeneration include chronic alcohol abuse, head injury, paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic autoimmune ataxia, high altitude cerebral oedema, coeliac disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus and infectious or post-infectious cerebellitis.Ataxia may depend on hereditary disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum or of the spine; most cases feature both to some extent, and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia, even though one is often more evident than the other. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computationxe2x80x94to general-purpose computationxe2x80x94and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.</blockquote>Though Lovelace is often referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.Allan G. Bromley, in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines:The Engineering in Computer Science and Telecommunications College building in Zaragoza University is called the Ada Byron Building.On 17 September 2013, an episode of Great Lives about Ada Lovelace aired.As of November 2015, all new British passports have included an illustration of Lovelace and Babbage on pages 46 and 47.In 2017, a Google Doodle honoured her on International Women's Day.On 2 February 2018, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a xc3x91uSat type micro-satellite named in honour of Ada Lovelace.In March 2018, The New York Times published a belated obituary for Ada Lovelace.On 27 July 2018, Senator Ron Wyden submitted, in the United States Senate, the designation of 9 October 2018 as National Ada Lovelace Day: "To honor the life and contributions of Ada Lovelace as a leading woman in science and mathematics".It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.In 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B.V.

<my-abstract> Though best remembered as the first book publisher of the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, and for his own contributions to the Cthulhu Mythos and the cosmic horror genre, as well as his founding of the publisher Arkham House (which did much to bring supernatural fiction into print in hardcover in the US that had only been readily available in the UK), Derleth was a leading American regional writer of his day, as well as prolific in several other genres, including  historical fiction, poetry, detective fiction, science fiction, and biography.A 1938 Guggenheim Fellow, Derleth considered his most serious work to be the ambitious Sac Prairie Saga, a series of fiction, historical fiction, poetry, and non-fiction naturalist works designed to memorialize life in the Wisconsin he knew.This practice has raised objections in some quarters that Derleth simply used Lovecraft's name to market what was essentially his own fiction; S. T. Joshi refers to the "posthumous collaborations" as marking the beginning of "perhaps the most disreputable phase of Derleth's activities".Dirk W. Mosig, were dissatisfied with Derleth's invention of the term Cthulhu Mythos (Lovecraft himself used Yog-Sothothery) and his presentation of Lovecraft's fiction as having an overall pattern reflecting Derleth's own Christian world view, which they contrast with Lovecraft's depiction of an amoral universe. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The variances in nomenclature in the region spanned by the Alps makes classification of the mountains and subregions difficult, but a general classification is that of the Eastern Alps and Western Alps with the divide between the two occurring in eastern Switzerland according to geologist Stefan Schmid, near the Splxc3xbcgen Pass. The highest peaks of the Western Alps and Eastern Alps, respectively, are Mont Blanc, at  at , respectivelySeries of lower mountain ranges run parallel to the main chain of the Alps, including the French Prealps in France and the Jura Mountains in Switzerland and France.Larger cities outside the Alps are Milan, Verona, Turin (Italy), Munich (Germany), Vienna, Salzburg (Austria), Zurich, Geneva (Switzerland) and Lyon (France).Cities with over 100,000 inhabitants in the Alps are:The population of the region is 14& million spread across eight countries.Much of the Alpine culture is unchanged since the medieval period when skills that guaranteed survival in the mountain valleys and in the highest villages became mainstays, leading to strong traditions of carpentry, woodcarving, baking and pastry-making, and cheesemaking.Farming had been a traditional occupation for centuries, although it became less dominant in the 20th century with the advent of tourism.Until this point Austria and Switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports, but by the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century, France, Italy and the Tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors.In the 17th century about 2500 people were killed by an avalanche in a village on the French-Italian border; in the 19th century 120 homes in a village near Zermatt were destroyed by an avalanche.The region is serviced by  of roads used by six million vehicles per year.Some high mountain villages are car free either because of inaccessibility or by choice.The sequence of Tethyan marine sediments and their oceanic basement is sandwiched between rock derived from the African and European plates.The core regions of the Alpine orogenic belt have been folded and fractured in such a manner that erosion created the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the Swiss Alps that rise seemingly straight out of the foreland areas.Due to the ever-present geologic instability, earthquakes continue in the Alps to this day.The Alps are a source of minerals that have been mined for thousands of years.In the mid-19th century the now defunct theory of geosynclines was used to explain the presence of "folded" mountain chains but by the mid-20th century the theory of plate tectonics became widely accepted.The formation of the Alps (the Alpine orogeny) was an episodic process that began about 300& million years ago.Under extreme compressive stresses and pressure, marine sedimentary rocks were uplifted, creating characteristic recumbent folds, or nappes, and thrust faults.The Alpine orogeny occurred in ongoing cycles through to the Paleogene causing differences in nappe structures, with a late-stage orogeny causing the development of the Jura Mountains.Climatic conditions show variances within the same zones; for example, weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley, extending directly from the peaks, are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall.Various models of climate change have been projected into the 22nd century for the Alps, with an expectation that a trend toward increased temperatures will have an effect on snowfall, snowpack, glaciation, and river runoff.Above the forestry, there is often a band of short pine trees (Pinus mugo), which is in turn superseded by Alpenrosen, dwarf shrubs, typically Rhododendron ferrugineum (on acid soils) or Rhododendron hirsutum (on alkaline soils).Alpine plants such as the Alpine gentian grow in abundance in areas such as the meadows above the Lauterbrunnental. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Christie sold an estimated 300 million books during her lifetime.In 2004, Hicks' obituary in The Telegraph noted that she had been "determined to remain true to her mother's vision and to protect the integrity of her creations" and disapproved of "merchandising" activities.Christie's family and family trusts, including great-grandson James Prichard, continue to own the 36% stake in Agatha Christie Limited,In 1998, Booker sold its shares in Agatha Christie Limited (at the time earning xc2xa32,100,000, approximately  annual revenue) for xc2xa310,000,000 (approximately ) to Chorion, whose portfolio of authors' works included the literary estates of Enid Blyton and Dennis Wheatley. In late February 2014, media reports stated that the BBC had acquired exclusive TV rights to Christie's works in the UK (previously associated with ITV) and made plans with Acorn's co-operation to air new productions for the 125th anniversary of Christie's birth in 2015.Christie's first published book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, was released in 1920 and introduced the detective Hercule Poirot, who appeared in thirty-three of her novels and more than fifty short stories.With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under Ronald Knox's "Ten Rules for Detective Fiction".}}In her youth, Christie showed little interest in antiquities.For the 1931 digging season at Nineveh, Christie bought a writing table to continue her own work; in the early 1950s, she paid to add a small writing room to the team's house at Nimrud.Many of the settings for Christie's books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the Middle East; this is reflected in the detail with which she describes themfor instance, the temple of Abu Simbel as depicted in Death on the Nilewhile the settings for They Came to Baghdad were places she and Mallowan had recently stayed.After the Second World War, Christie chronicled her time in Syria in Come, Tell Me How You Live, which she described as "small beera very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings".BBC television released Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures in 2004, in which she is portrayed by Olivia Williams, Anna Massey, and Bonnie Wright (at different stages in her life).Both books were sealed in a bank vault, and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy.In 2013, the Christie family supported the release of a new Poirot story, The Monogram Murders, written by British author Sophie Hannah.Christie has been called the "Duchess of Death", the "Mistress of Mystery", and the "Queen of Crime".She developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the "Golden Age" of detective fiction.Christie did not limit herself to quaint English villagesthe action might take place on a small island (And Then There Were None), an aeroplane (Death in the Clouds), a train (Murder on the Orient Express), a steamship (Death on the Nile), a smart London flat (Cards on the Table), a resort in the West Indies (A Caribbean Mystery), or an archaeological dig (Murder in Mesopotamia)but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate: family members, friends, servants, business associates, fellow travellers.Agatha Christie: An Autobiography was published posthumously in 1977 and adjudged the Best Critical / Biographical Work at the 1978 Edgar Awards.The inspirations for some of Christie's titles include:Christie biographer Gillian Gill said, "Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed."Of necessity, the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel.In 2013, the 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association chose The Murder of Roger Ackroyd as "the best whodunit... ever written".In September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, And Then There Were None was named the "World's Favourite Christie" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> When the imaginary part  is zero, this coincides with the definition of the absolute value of the real number& .When a complex number&  is expressed in its polar form aswith <math>r = sqrt{[mathrm{Re}(z)]^2 + [mathrm{Im}(z)]^2} ge 0</math> (and  is the argument (or phase) of z), its absolute value isSince the product of any complex number&  and its complex conjugate& <math>bar z = x - iy,</math> with the same absolute value, is always the non-negative real number <math>(x^2+y^2)</math>, the absolute value of a complex number can be conveniently expressed asresembling the alternative definition for reals: <math>|x| = sqrt{xcdot x}.</math>The complex absolute value shares the four fundamental properties given above for the real absolute value.In the language of group theory, the multiplicative property may be rephrased as follows: the absolute value is a group homomorphism from the multiplicative group of the complex numbers onto the group under multiplication of positive real numbers.Importantly, the property of subadditivity ("triangle inequality") extends to any finite collection of & complex {{nowrap|numbers <math display="inline">(z_k)_{k=1}^n </math> as}}This inequality also applies to infinite families, provided that the infinite series <math display="inline">sum_{k=1}^infty z_k</math> is absolutely convergent.The following computation then affords the desired inequality: It is clear from this proof that equality holds in <math>(*)</math> exactly if all the <math>cz_k</math> are non-negative real numbers, which in turn occurs exactly if all nonzero <math>z_k</math> have the same argument, i.e., <math>z_k=a_kzeta</math> for a complex constant <math>zeta</math> and real constants <math>a_k geq 0</math> for <math>1le k le n</math>.Since <math>f</math> measurable implies that <math>|f|</math> is also measurable, the proof of the inequality <math>(**)</math> proceeds via the same technique, by replacing <math display="inline">sum_k(cdot)</math> with <math display="inline">int_E (cdot), dx</math> and <math>z_k</math> with <math>f(x)</math>..The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.If  is an absolute value on& , then the function&  on , defined by , is a metric and the following are equivalent:An absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be non-Archimedean, otherwise it is said to be Archimedean.Again the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalise the notion to an arbitrary vector space.A real-valued function on a vector space&  over a field& , represented as }}, is called an absolute value, but more usually a norm, if it satisfies the following axioms:For all&  in& , and ,  in& ,The norm of a vector is also called its length or magnitude.In the case of Euclidean space& , the function defined byis a norm called the Euclidean norm.As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.The standard Euclidean distance between two pointsandin Euclidean -space is defined as:This can be seen as a generalisation, since for <math>a_1</math> and <math>b_1</math> real, i.e. </my-abstract>

Mason's fictional detective Inspector Hanaud of the French Sxc3xbbretxc3xa9, who first appeared in the 1910 novel At the Villa Rose and predates the first Poirot novel by ten years.Unlike the models mentioned above, Christie's Poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book, written in 1916 and published in 1920.In the film, Thirteen at Dinner (1985), adapted from Lord Edgware Dies, the role of Japp was taken by the actor David Suchet, who would later star as Poirot in the ITV adaptations.The Poirot books take readers through the whole of his life in England, from the first book (The Mysterious Affair at Styles), where he is a refugee staying at Styles, to the last Poirot book (Curtain), where he visits Styles before his death.He admits as much:He also has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person.In later novels, Christie often uses the word mountebank when characters describe Poirot, showing that he has successfully passed himself off as a charlatan or fraud.Poirot's investigating techniques assist him solving cases; "For in the long run, either through a lie, or through truth, people were bound to give themselves away..." At the end, Poirot usually reveals his description of the sequence of events and his deductions to a room of suspects, often leading to the culprit's apprehension.Christie was purposely vague about Poirot's origins, as he is thought to be an elderly man even in the early novels."In Revenge of the Pink Panther, Poirot makes a cameo appearance in a mental asylum, portrayed by Andrew Sachs and claiming to be "the greatest detective in all of France, the greatest in all the world".In Neil Simon's Murder by Death, American actor James Coco plays "Milo Perrier", a parody of Poirot.Dudley Jones played Poirot in the film The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It (1977).In the film Spice World, Hugh Laurie plays Poirot.Yet the public loved him and Christie refused to kill him off, claiming that it was her duty to produce what the public liked.Captain Arthur Hastings's first description of Poirot:}}Agatha Christie's initial description of Poirot in The Murder on the Orient Express:}}In the later books, his limp is not mentioned, suggesting it may have been a temporary wartime injury.He moved into Styles Court towards the end of his life.While Poirot was usually paid handsomely by clients, he was also known to take on cases that piqued his curiosity, although they did not pay well.Poirot shows a love of steam trains, which Christie contrasts with Hastings' love of autos: this is shown in The Plymouth Express, The Mystery of the Blue Train, Murder on the Orient Express, and The ABC Murders (in the TV series, steam trains are seen in nearly all of the episodes).Confusion surrounds Poirot's retirement. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> When Moses at first declined to go to Pharaoh, saying: "O my Lord, send, I pray, by the hand of him whom you will send" (Exodus 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive Aaron of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but the Lord reassured him, saying: "Behold, when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart" ().When Moses poured the oil of anointment upon the head of Aaron, Aaron modestly shrank back and said: "Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office."The Quran then adds that Moses here lamented the sins of Israel, and said that he only had power over himself and Aaron (Quran 5: 25).Aaron is later commemorated in the Quran as one who had a "clear authority" (Quran 23: 45) and one who was "guided to the Right Path" (Quran 37: 118). </my-abstract>

<title>Alcohol</title>
<wiki-abstract> In chemistry, alcohol is an organic compound that carries at least one hydroxyl functional group (−OH) bound to a saturated carbon atom. The term alcohol originally referred to the primary alcohol ethanol (ethyl alcohol), which is used as a drug and is the main alcohol present in alcoholic beverages. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Tertiary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an aldehyde hydrate (R-CH(OH)) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.Reagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones.In naming simple alcohols, the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal e and adds the suffix -ol, e.g., as in "ethanol" from the alkane chain name "ethane".In cases where the OH functional group is bonded to an sp<sup>2</sup> carbon on an aromatic ring the molecule is known as a phenol, and is named using the IUPAC rules for naming phenols.In other less formal contexts, an alcohol is often called with the name of the corresponding alkyl group followed by the word "alcohol", e.g., methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol.The oxidation of secondary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>CH-OH) normally terminates at the ketone (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>C=O) stage. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Ginsberg had several political connections in India; most notably Pupul Jayakar who helped him extend his stay in India when the authorities were eager to expel him.In May 1965, Ginsberg arrived in London, and offered to read anywhere for free.Soon after the bookshop reading, plans were hatched for the International Poetry Incarnation, and shared what he learned from Dwight Goddard's Buddhist Bible with Ginsberg.Ginsberg's spiritual journey began early on with his spontaneous visions, and continued with an early trip to India with Gary Snyder.After returning to the United States, a chance encounter on a New York City street with Chxc3xb6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche (they both tried to catch the same cab),Despite disagreeing with many of Bhaktivedanta Swami's required prohibitions, Ginsberg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly as part of his philosophyGinsberg: So what do you think of Swami Bhaktivedanta pleading for the acceptance of Krishna in every direction?<br />Snyder: Why, it's a lovely positive thing to say Krishna.To create music for Howl and Wichita Vortex Sutra he worked with the minimalist composer, Philip Glass.Ginsberg worked with, drew inspiration from, and inspired artists such as Bob Dylan, The Clash, Patti Smith, Phil Ochs, and The Fugs.In 1996, he also recorded a song co-written with Paul McCartney and Philip Glass, "The Ballad of the Skeletons", Ginsberg stated that Whitman's long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further, and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form.Many of Ginsberg's early long line experiments contain some sort of anaphora, repetition of a "fixed base" (for example "who" in "Howl", "America" in America) and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsberg's style.The mantras, the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association& [...] [W]hen somebody comes in from the Orient with a new religion which hasn't got any of [horrible] associations in our minds, all the words are new, all the rites are new, and yet, somehow it has feeling in it, and we can get with that, you see, and we can dig that!</ref>On January 17, 1967, Ginsberg helped plan and organize a reception for Bhaktivedanta Swami at San Francisco International Airport, where fifty to a hundred hippies greeted the Swami, chanting Hare Krishna in the airport lounge with flowers in hands.Music and chanting were both important parts of Ginsberg's live delivery during poetry readings.At the 1967 Human Be-In in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and the 1970 Black Panther rally at Yale campus Allen chanted "Om" repeatedly over a sound system for hours on end.Ginsberg further brought mantras into the world of rock and roll when he recited the Heart Sutra in the song "Ghetto Defendant".An account of that night can be found in Kerouac's novel The Dharma Bums, describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.Ginsberg's principal work, "Howl", is well known for its opening line: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked& [...]" "Howl" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language.Before Howl and Other Poems was published in 1956 by City Lights Bookshop, he worked as a market researcher.In 1954, in San Francisco, Ginsberg met Peter Orlovsky (1933xe2x80x932010), with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner.Also in San Francisco, Ginsberg met members of the San Francisco Renaissance (James Broughton, Robert Duncan, Madeline Gleason and Kenneth Rexroth) and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> But if q(x)& =& x<sup>n</sup>& +& a, then q(x) is the characteristic polynomial of the nxc3x97n companion matrixThe field F is algebraically closed if and only if every rational function in one variable x, with coefficients in F, can be written as the sum of a polynomial function with rational functions of the form a/(x& &minus;& b)<sup>n</sup>, where n is a natural number, and a and b are elements of F.If F is algebraically closed then, since the irreducible polynomials in F[x] are all of degree 1, the property stated above holds by the theorem on partial fraction decomposition.On the other hand, suppose that the property stated above holds for the field F. Let p(x) be an irreducible element in F[x].On the other hand, that the property stated here holds for F if F is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that, for any field K, any polynomial in K[x] can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials.If every polynomial over F of prime degree has a root in F, then every non-constant polynomial has a root in F. It follows that a field is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial over F of prime degree has a root in F.The field F is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper algebraic extension.If F has no proper algebraic extension, let p(x) be some irreducible polynomial in F[x]. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b'      DESCRIPTION: Motorsport involving the racing of cars for competition.{ }Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing, or automobile racing) is a motorsport involving the racing of automobiles for competition.Auto racing has existed since the invention of the automobile.All three Le Mans Series run GT cars in addition to Le Mans Prototypes; these cars have different restrictions than the FIA GT cars.Another prototype and GT racing championship exists in the United States; the Grand-Am, which began in 2000, sanctions its own endurance series, the Rolex Sports Car Series, which consists of slower and lower-cost race cars compared to LMP and FIA GT cars.The group was an assemblage of drivers from different racing disciplines and formed for an MTV reality pilot, which was shot at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.In December 2005, the FIA gave approval to Superleague Formula racing, which debuted in 2008, whereby the racing teams are owned and run by prominent sports clubs such as A.C. Milan and Liverpool F.C.After 25 years away from the sport, former Formula 2 champion Jonathan Palmer reopened the F2 category again; most drivers have graduated from the Formula Palmer Audi series.The European races eventually became the closely related Le Mans Series, both of which mix prototypes and GTs.Turismo Carretera (Road racing, lit., Road Touring) is a popular touring car racing series in Argentina, and the oldest car racing series still active in the world. </my-abstract>

<title>Anarcho-capitalism</title>
<wiki-abstract> Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy and economic theory that advocates the elimination of centralized states in favor of free markets, private property and the right-libertarian interpretation of self-ownership. In the absence of statute, anarcho-capitalists hold that society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through participation in the free market which they describe as a voluntary society. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho-capitalist system is what anarcho-capitalists see as the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho-capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which they believe would be necessary under a "coercively" egalitarian-anarchist system.Despite their name, anarcho-capitalists are generally seen by anarchists, who reject the notion of capitalism, hierarchies and private property,While both anarchism and anarcho-capitalism are in opposition to the state, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition because anarchists and anarcho-capitalists intepret state-rejection differently.In his essay The Production of Security, Gustave de Molinari argued that "[n]o government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity".This society vs. state idea was expressed in various ways such as natural society vs. artificial society, liberty vs. authority, society of contract vs. society of authority and industrial society vs. militant society, just to name a few.Ruth Kinna writes that anarcho-capitalism is a term coined by Murray Rothbard to describe "a commitment to unregulated private property and laissez-faire economics, prioritizing the liberty-rights of individuals, unfettered by government regulation, to accumulate, consume and determine the patterns of their lives as they see fit".The bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him.In the context of revolution, Rothbard stated that the American Revolutionary War was the only war involving the United States that could be justified.Rothbard, Murray N., [https://mises.org/library/betrayal-american-right-0 The Betrayal of the American Right] (2007): 188</ref> and is also used by the Swedish AnarkoKapitalistisk Front]]In both its social and individualist forms, anarchism is usually considered an anti-capitalistAnarcho-capitalists are distinguished from the dominant anarchist tradition by their relation to property and capital.However, they see challenges stemming from this idea such as whether an individual might claim fishing rights in the area of a major shipping lane and thereby forbid passage through it.The society envisioned by anarcho-capitalists has been called the "contractual society" which Rothbard described as "a society based purely on voluntary action, entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence" Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker accepted the use of violence as means of enforcing them.Rothbard argues that corporations would exist in a free society as they are "simply the pooling of capital". </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> We know however from a combination of these sources,Comments made by the Chorus referring to Aristophanes in The CloudsWe know that Aristophanes was probably victorious at least once at the City Dionysia (with Babylonians in 427)Plato's The Symposium appears to be a useful source of biographical information about Aristophanes, but its reliability is open to doubt.Aristophanes survived The Peloponnesian War, two oligarchic revolutions and two democratic restorations; this has been interpreted as evidence that he was not actively involved in politics despite his highly political plays.The early plays (The Acharnians to The Birds) are fairly uniform in their approach however and the following elements of a parabasis can be found within them.The Wasps is thought to offer the best example of a conventional approach and the elements of a parabasis can be identified and located in that play as follows.Textual corruption is probably the reason for the absence of the antistrophe in the second parabasis.However, there are several variations from the ideal even within the early plays.An understanding of Old Comedy conventions such as the parabasis is necessary for a proper understanding of Aristophanes' plays; on the other hand, a sensitive appreciation of the plays is necessary for a proper understanding of the conventions.The tragic dramatists, Sophocles and Euripides, died near the end of the Peloponnesian War and the art of tragedy thereafter ceased to develop, yet comedy did continue to evolve after the defeat of Athens and it is possible that it did so because, in Aristophanes, it had a master craftsman who lived long enough to help usher it into a new age.Latin translations of the plays by Andreas Divus (Venice 1528) were circulated widely throughout Europe in the Renaissance and these were soon followed by translations and adaptations in modern languages. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The hospital suffered from squalor and was without modern amenities, and Schweitzer had little contact with the local people.The poor conditions of the hospital in Lambarxc3xa9nxc3xa9 were also famously criticized by Nigerian professor and novelist Chinua Achebe in his essay on Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness: "In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says: 'The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother.' And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being.According to a visitor, Dr. Gaine Cannon, of Balsam Grove, N.C., the old, dilapidated piano-organ was still being played by Dr. Schweitzer in 1962, and stories told that "his fingers were still lively" on the old instrument at 88 years of age.Sir Donald Tovey dedicated his conjectural completion of Bach's The Art of Fugue to Schweitzer.Schweitzer's recordings of organ-music, and his innovative recording technique, are described below.One of his pupils was conductor and composer Hans Mxc3xbcnch.In 1899, Schweitzer became a deacon at the church of Saint Nicholas in Strasbourg.He envisaged instruments in which the French late-romantic full-organ sound should work integrally with the English and German romantic reed pipes, and with the classical Alsace Silbermann organ resources and baroque flue pipes, all in registers regulated (by stops) to access distinct voices in fugue or counterpoint capable of combination without loss of distinctness: different voices singing the same music together.Schweitzer also studied piano under Isidor Philipp, head of the piano department at the Paris Conservatory.In 1905, Widor and Schweitzer were among the six musicians who founded the Paris Bach Society, a choir dedicated to performing J.S. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Austrian economist Steven Horwitz argued in 2000 that Austrian methodology is consistent with macroeconomics and that Austrian macroeconomics can be expressed in terms of microeconomic foundations.In 1981, Fritz Machlup listed the typical views of Austrian economic thinking as such:He included two additional tenets held by the Mises branch of Austrian economics:The opportunity cost doctrine was first explicitly formulated by the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser in the late 19th century.Opportunity cost is a key concept in mainstream economics and has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice".In Mises's definition, inflation is an increase in the supply of money: Hayek pointed out that inflationary stimulation exploits the lag between an increase in money supply and the consequent increase in the prices of goods and services: The economic calculation problem refers to a criticism of socialism which was first stated by Max Weber in 1920.Mises stated that this artificial "boom" then led to a misallocation of resources which he called "malinvestment" - which eventually must end in a "bust".Mises surmised how government manipulation of money and credit in the banking system throws savings and investment out of balance, resulting in misdirected investment projects that are eventually found to be unsustainable, at which point the economy has to rebalance itself through a period of corrective recession.According to Ludwig von Mises, central banks enable the commercial banks to fund loans at artificially low interest rates, thereby inducing an unsustainable expansion of bank credit and impeding any subsequent contraction and argued for a gold standard to constrain growth in fiduciary media.Mainstream economists generally reject modern-day Austrian economics, and have argued that modern-day Austrian economists are excessively averse to the use of mathematics and statistics in economics.Economist Paul Krugman has stated that they are unaware of holes in their own thinking because Austrians do not use "explicit models".Economist Benjamin Klein has criticized the economic methodological work of Austrian economist Israel M. Kirzner. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Skin abscesses are common; internal abscesses tend to be harder to diagnose, and more serious.For those with a history of intravenous drug use, an X-ray is recommended before treatment to verify that no needle fragments are present.Abscesses should be differentiated from empyemas, which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting, rather than a newly formed, anatomical cavity.Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms include: cellulitis, a sebaceous cyst, and necrotising fasciitis.The standard treatment for an uncomplicated skin or soft tissue abscess is the act of opening and draining.Abscess five days after incision and drainage.The abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause, which may require their removal.However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.File:Blausen 0007 Abscess.png|A diagram of an abscess.file:Pyemic abscesses of kidney.jpg|Pyemic abscesses of a kidney.An abscess is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by the pyogenic membrane.Abscesses may be classified as either skin abscesses or internal abscesses. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The newly reconstructed area of Skjoldhxc3xb8jkilen is a prime example.Aarhus has hosted many sporting events including the 2010 European Women's Handball Championship, the 2014 European Men's Handball Championship, the 2013 Men's European Volleyball Championships, the 2005 European Table Tennis Championships, the Denmark Open in badminton, the UCI Women's Road Cycling World Cup, the 2006 World Orienteering Championships, the 2006 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships and the GF World Cup (women's handball).Since 2012, Aarhus University (AU) has been the largest university in Denmark by number of students enrolled.Aarhus Tech is one of the largest technical colleges in Denmark, teaching undergraduate study programmes in English, including vocational education and training (VET), continuing vocational training (CVT), and human resource development.The northern part dubbed Aarhus xc3x98 (Aarhus Docklands) is almost finished as of 2018, while the southern district dubbed Sydhavnskvarteret (The South-harbour neighbourhood) is only starting to be developed.Construction of Aarhus Letbane, the first light rail system in the country, commenced in 2013, and the first increment was finished in December 2017.At Aarhus's location, the Bay of Aarhus provides a natural harbour with a depth of  quite close to the shore."Aa" was also used by some major institutions between 1948-2011 as well, such as Aarhus University or the largest local sports club,  (AGF), who have never used the "xc3x85"-spelling.Founded in the early Viking Age, Aarhus is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, along with Ribe and Hedeby.Archaeological evidence under the Aros settlement's defences indicate the site was a town as early as the last quarter of the 8th& century, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed.The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 948 when Adam of Bremen reported the bishop Reginbrand attended the synod of Ingelheim in Germany.The official and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthen ramparts, ringing the town since the Viking age, were abandoned to accommodate expansion.Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture has long been a marginal sector within the municipality.Several major companies have their headquarters in Aarhus, such as Arla Foods, one of the largest dairy groups in Europe, Salling Group, Denmark's largest retailer, Jysk, a worldwide retailer specialising in household goods, bedding, furniture and interior design, Vestas, the largest wind turbine manufacturer in the world by market share,), and Bestseller A/S.The Port of Aarhus is one of the largest industrial ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's container traffic and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world.The urban area of Aarhus and the immediate suburbs are divided into the districts Aarhus C, Aarhus N, Aarhus V, Viby J, Hxc3xb8jbjerg and Brabrand.Aarhus has increasingly been investing in environmental planning and, in accordance with national policy, aims to be CO2-neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030.The municipality aims for a coherent and holistic administration of the water cycle to protect against, or clean up, previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Alexis Carrel was also a member of learned societies in the U.S., Spain, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Vatican City, Germany, Italy and Greece and received honorary doctorates from Queen's University of Belfast, Princeton University, California, New York, Brown University and Columbia University.In 1902, he was claimed to have witnessed the miraculous cure of Marie Bailly at Lourdes, made famous in part because she named Carrel as a witness of her cure.In 1906 he joined the newly formed Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in New York where he spent the rest of his career.It was in fact Lindbergh's disappointment that contemporary medical technology could not provide an artificial heart pump which would allow for heart surgery on her that led to Lindbergh's first contact with Carrel.In 1902 Alexis Carrel went from being a skeptic of the visions and miracles reported at Lourdes to being a believer in spiritual cures after experiencing a healing of Marie Bailly that he could not explain. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> At bedtime, the supper is left on the table for the souls.In Malta, on All Souls' Day (known in Maltese as Jum il-Mejtin), a traditional supper includes roasted pig, based on a custom of letting a pig loose on the streets with a bell around its neck, to be fed by the entire neighborhood and cooked on that day to feed the poor.In Linz, funereal musical pieces known as aequales were played from tower tops on All Souls' Day and the evening before.In the Philippines, Hallow mas is variously called "Undxc3xa1s", "Todos los Santos" (Spanish, "All Saints"), and sometimes "Araw ng mga Patay / Yumao" (Tagalog, "Day of the dead / those who have passed away"), which incorporates All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day.This custom was later also adopted by the non-Prussian Lutherans in Germany, but it has not spread much beyond the Protestant areas of Germany.In the Church of England it is called The Commemoration of the Faithful Departed and is an optional celebration; Anglicans view All Souls' Day as an extension of the observance of All Saints' Day and it serves to "remember those who have died", in connection with the theological doctrines of the resurrection of the body and the Communion of Saints.In the Anglican Communion, All Souls' Day is known liturgically as the Commemoration of All Faithful Departed, and is an optional observance seen as "an extension of All Saints' Day", the latter of which marks the second day of Allhallowtide. </my-abstract>

<title>Algorithms for calculating variance</title>
<wiki-abstract> Algorithms for calculating variance play a major role in computational statistics. A key difficulty in the design of good algorithms for this problem is that formulas for the variance may involve sums of squares, which can lead to numerical instability as well as to arithmetic overflow when dealing with large values. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> This is a serious problem with naxc3xafve algorithm and is due to catastrophic cancellation in the subtraction of two similar numbers at the final stage of the algorithm.Terriberry extends Chan's formulae to calculating the third and fourth central moments, needed for example when estimating skewness and kurtosis:begin{align}M_{3,X} = M_{3,A} + M_{3,B} & {} + delta^3frac{n_A n_B (n_A - n_B)}{n_X^2} + 3deltafrac{n_AM_{2,B} - n_BM_{2,A}}{n_X} [6pt]M_{4,X} = M_{4,A} + M_{4,B} & {} + delta^4frac{n_A n_B left(n_A^2 - n_A n_B + n_B^2right)}{n_X^3} [6pt]                    & {} + 6delta^2frac{n_A^2 M_{2,B} + n_B^2 M_{2,A}}{n_X^2} + 4deltafrac{n_AM_{3,B} - n_BM_{3,A}}{n_X}end{align}</math>Here the <math>M_k</math> are again the sums of powers of differences from the mean <math>sum(x - overline{x})^k</math>, givingbegin{align}end{align}For the incremental case (i.e., <math>B = {x}</math>), this simplifies to:begin{align}delta & = x - m [5pt]m' & = m + frac{delta}{n} [5pt]M_2' & = M_2 + delta^2 frac{n-1}{n} [5pt]M_3' & = M_3 + delta^3 frac{ (n - 1) (n - 2)}{n^2} - frac{3delta M_2}{n} [5pt]M_4' & = M_4 + frac{delta^4 (n - 1) (n^2 - 3n + 3)}{n^3} + frac{6delta^2 M_2}{n^2} - frac{4delta M_3}{n}end{align}By preserving the value <math>delta / n</math>, only one division operation is needed and the higher-order statistics can thus be calculated for little incremental cost.An example of the online algorithm for kurtosis implemented as described is:def online_kurtosis(data):    n = mean = M2 = M3 = M4 = 0    for x in data:        n1 = n        n = n + 1        delta = x -

4 * delta_n * M3        M3 = M3 + term1 * delta_n * (n - 2) - 3 * delta_n * M2        M2 = M2 + term1    # Note, you may also calculate variance using M2, and skewness using M3    kurtosis = (n * M4) / (M2 * M2) - 3    return kurtosisPxc3xa9baxc3xbffurther extends these results to arbitrary-order central moments, for the incremental and the pairwise cases, and subsequently Pxc3xa9baxc3xbf et al.for weighted and compound moments.Even greater accuracy can be achieved by first computing the means, then using the stable one-pass algorithm on the residuals.Thus the covariance can be computed asoperatorname{Cov}_N(X,Y) = frac{C_N}{N} &= frac{operatorname{Cov}_{N-1}(X,Y)cdot(N-1) + (x_n - bar x_n)(y_n - bar y_{n-1})}{N}   &= frac{operatorname{Cov}_{N-1}(X,Y)cdot(N-1) + (x_n - bar x_{n-1})(y_n - bar y_n)}{N}   &= frac{operatorname{Cov}_{N-1}(X,Y)cdot(N-1) + frac{N-1}{N}(x_n - bar x_{n-1})(y_n - bar y_{n-1})}{N}   &= frac{operatorname{Cov}_{N-1}(X,Y)cdot(N-1) + frac{N}{N-1}(x_n - bar x_{n})(y_n - bar y_{n})}{N}.end{align}</math>def online_covariance(data1, data2):    meanx = meany = C = n = 0    for x, y in zip(data1, data2):        n += 1        dx = x -

A better quantity for updating is the sum of squares of differences from the current mean, <math>textstylesum_{i=1}^n (x_i - bar x_n)^2</math>, here denoted <math>M_{2,n}</math>:begin{align}M_{2,n} & = M_{2,n-1} + (x_n - bar x_{n-1})(x_n - bar x_n) [4pt]s^2_n & = frac{M_{2,n}}{n-1} [4pt]sigma^2_n & = frac{M_{2,n}}{n}end{align}This algorithm was found by Welford,An example Python implementation for Welford's algorithm is given below.# For a new value newValue, compute the new count, new mean, the new M2.# mean accumulates the mean of the entire dataset# M2 aggregates the squared distance from the mean# count aggregates the number of samples seen so fardef update(existingAggregate, newValue):    (count, mean, M2) = existingAggregate    count += 1    delta = newValue - mean    mean += delta / count    delta2 = newValue - mean    M2 += delta * delta2    return (count, mean, M2)# Retrieve the mean, variance and sample variance from an aggregatedef finalize(existingAggregate):    (count, mean, M2) = existingAggregate    if count < 2:        return float("nan")    else:        (mean, variance, sampleVariance) = (mean, M2 / count, M2 / (count - 1))        return (mean, variance, sampleVariance)This algorithm is much less prone to loss of precision due to catastrophic cancellation, but might not be as efficient because of the division operation inside the loop.The final sums <math>textstylesum x_i</math> and <math>textstylesum y_i</math> should be zero, but the second pass compensates for any small error.A stable one-pass algorithm exists, similar to the online algorithm for computing the variance, that computes co-moment <math>textstyle C_n = sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - bar x_n)(y_i - bar y_n)</math>:bar x_n &= bar x_{n-1} &,+,& frac{x_n - bar x_{n-1}}{n} [5pt]bar y_n &= bar y_{n-1} &,+,& frac{y_n - bar y_{n-1}}{n} [5pt]C_n      &= C_{n-1}      &,+,& (x_n - bar x_n)(y_n - bar y_{n-1}) [5pt]         &= C_{n-1}      &,+,& (x_n - bar x_{n-1})(y_n - bar y_n)end{alignat}</math>The apparent asymmetry in that last equation is due to the fact that <math>textstyle (x_n - bar x_n) = frac{n-1}{n}(x_n - bar x_{n-1})</math>, so both update terms are equal to <math>textstyle frac{n-1}{n}(x_n - bar x_{n-1})(y_n - bar y_{n-1})</math>.Taking the first value of each data set, the algorithm can be written as:def shifted_data_covariance(data_x, data_y):    n = len(data_x)    if n < 2:        return 0    kx = data_x[0]    ky = data_y[0]    Ex = Ey = Exy = 0    for ix, iy in zip(data_x, data_y):        Ex += ix - kx        Ey += iy - ky        Exy += (ix - kx) * (iy - ky)    return (Exy - Ex * Ey / n) / nThe two-pass algorithm first computes the sample means, and then the covariance:The two-pass algorithm may be written as:def two_pass_covariance(data1, data2):    n = len(data1)    mean1 = sum(data1) / n    mean2 = sum(data2) / n    covariance = 0    for i1, i2 in zip(data1, data2):        a = i1 - mean1        b = i2 - mean2        covariance += a * b / n    return covarianceA slightly more accurate compensated version performs the full naive algorithm on the residuals.West (1979) suggests this incremental algorithm:def weighted_incremental_variance(data_weight_pairs):    w_sum = w_sum2 = mean = S = 0    for x, w in data_weight_pairs:  # Alternatively "for x, w in zip(data, weights):"        w_sum = w_sum + w        w_sum2 = w_sum2 + w * w        mean_old = mean        mean = mean_old + (w / w_sum) * (x - mean_old)        S = S + w * (x - mean_old) * (x - mean)    population_variance = S / w_sum    # Bessel's correction for weighted samples    # Frequency weights    sample_frequency_variance = S / (w_sum - 1)    # Reliability weights    sample_reliability_variance = S / (w_sum - w_sum2 / w_sum)Chan et al.This methodology could be used for parallel computation of statistical moments with subsequent combination of those moments, or for combination of statistical moments computed at sequential times.If <math>Q</math> sets of statistical moments are known:quad </math> for <math>q=1,2,ldots,Q </math>, then each <math>gamma_n</math> canbe expressed in terms of the equivalent <math>n</math> raw moments:gamma_{n,q}= m_{n,q} gamma_{0,q} qquad quad textrm{for} quad n=1,2,3,4  quad text{ and } quad q = 1,2, dots ,Qwhere <math>gamma_{0,q}</math> is generally taken to be the duration of the <math>q^{th}</math> time-history, or the number of points if <math>Delta t</math> is constant.The benefit of expressing the statistical moments in terms of <math>gamma</math> is that the <math>Q</math> sets can be combined by addition, and there is no upper limit on the value of <math>Q</math>. gamma_{n,c}= sum_{q=1}^Q gamma_{n,q} quad quad text{for } n=0,1,2,3,4where the subscript <math>_c</math> represents the concatenated time-history or combined <math>gamma</math>. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Raw, blanched, and lightly toasted almonds work well for different production techniques, some of which are similar to that of soymilk and some of which use no heat, resulting in "raw milk" (see raw foodism).Almond milk, along with almond butter and almond oil, is a versatile products used in both sweet and savoury dishes.In Moroccan cuisine, sharbat billooz is one of the best known beverages, served for weddings, it is made by blending blanched almonds with milk, sugar and other flavorings.Almond flour or ground almond meal combined with sugar or honey as marzipan is often used as a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour in cooking and baking.Historically, almond syrup was an emulsion of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with barley syrup (orgeat syrup) or in a syrup of orange flower water and sugar, often flavored with a synthetic aroma of almonds.Due to the cyanide found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds.ARS researchers have managed to crossbreed the pest-resistant Tuono tree with the Nonpareil, resulting in hybridized cultivars of almond trees that are self-pollinated and maintain a high nut quality.File:Almondtrees.jpg|A grove of almond trees in central CaliforniaFile:xd8xa8xd8xa7xd8xafxd8xa7xd9x85 xd9x88 xd8xb4xdaxa9xd9x88xd9x81xd9x87 xd8xa8xd8xa7xd8xafxd8xa7xd9x85.JPG|Almond blossoms in IranFile:Kulturmandel unreife Frxc3xbcchte.JPG|Young almond fruitFile:Madrigueras (20578932389) (cropped).jpg|Mature almond fruitFile:AlmondShakerbeforeafter.jpg|An almond shaker before and during a harvest of a treeAlmond trees can be attacked by an array of damaging organisms, including insects, fungal pathogens, plant viruses, and bacteria.In 2018, world production of almonds grew by 45% over the 2017 volume to 3.2 million tonnes, with the United States providing 59% of the world total.The almond blossom supplied a model for the menorah which stood in the Holy Temple, "Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers"  (Exodus 25:33xe2x80x9334; 37:19xe2x80x9320).Similarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the Virgin Birth of Jesus; paintings and icons often include almond-shaped haloes encircling the Christ Child and as a symbol of Mary. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews published by the Nation of Islam, and on the internet.Derek Penslar writes that there are two components to the financial canards:Abraham Foxman describes six facets of the financial canards:#All Jews are wealthy#Jews are stingy and greedy#Powerful Jews control the business world#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews#Jews use their power to benefit "their own kind"Gerald Krefetz summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businessesxe2x80x94of the community, of the country, of the world".Lxc3xa9on Poliakov asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism).Muslim-majority countries outside the Middle East similarly had few who held positive views of Jews, with 4% of Turks and 9% of Indonesians viewing Jews favorably.According to a 2011 exhibition at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, United States, some of the dialogue from Middle East media and commentators about Jews bear a striking resemblance to Nazi propaganda.Muslim clerics in the Middle East have frequently referred to Jews as descendants of apes and pigs, which are conventional epithets for Jews and Christians.According to professor Robert Wistrich, director of the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism (SICSA), the calls for the destruction of Israel by Iran or by Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, or the Muslim Brotherhood, represent a contemporary mode of genocidal antisemitism.Antisemitism has been explained in terms of racism, xenophobia, projected guilt, displaced aggression, and the search for a scapegoat.Education plays an important role in addressing and overcoming prejudice and countering social discrimination.A March 2008 report by the U.S. State Department found that there was an increase in antisemitism across the world, and that both old and new expressions of antisemitism persist.Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature#Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which wasxe2x80x94at least, in its classical formxe2x80x94nuanced in that Jews were a protected class#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism in the 20th century#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the New AntisemitismChanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; Christian antisemitism, which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.BBC correspondents who have watched the program says it quotes extensively from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.In March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that "Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books," to the extent that they are "an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA."Saudi textbooks vilify Jews, call Jews apes; demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in Jihad to vanquish Jews.Saudi Arabian government officials and state religious leaders often promote the idea that Jews are conspiring to take over the entire world; as proof of their claims they publish and frequently cite The Protocols of the Elders of Zion as factual.In 2004, the official Saudi Arabia tourism website said that Jews and holders of Israeli passports would not be issued visas to enter the country.Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of 6,000 Jews in Fez in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and Marrakesh in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232) were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in Demnat, Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.While the pro-Nazi Vichy regime during World War II passed discriminatory laws against Jews, King Muhammad prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported."Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to Olaf Blaschke, has become an "umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews", a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.Holocaust scholar and City University of New York professor Helen Fein defines it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actionsxe2x80x94social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violencexe2x80x94which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews.It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; denying the Holocaust or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of dual loyalty or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country.Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the "Jewish banker class".The University of Warsaw's study in 2016 found that 37% of surveyed Poles expressed negative attitudes towards Jews (up from 32% in 2015); 56% said that they wouldn't accept a Jew in their family (up from 46%); and 32% wouldn't want Jewish neighbors (up from 27%).In November 2015, following Antoni Macierewicz's (Law and Justice party) designation as Minister of National Defence, he faced allegations of antisemitism and protests by the Anti Defamation League.In February 2018, the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that "there were Jewish perpetrators" of the Holocaust, "not only German perpetrators." </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The report revealed the ties between Azerbaijani government and the members of certain observation missions who praised the elections.Non-governmental anti-corruption organization Transparency International has regularly judged Azerbaijan to be one of the most corrupt countries in the worldAt June 2016 the public prosecutor of Milan has accused the former leader of the (Christian) Union of the Center and of the European People's Party of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Luca Volonte of accepting large bribes from representatives of the Azerbaijani government.On 6 March 2017, ESISC (European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center) published a scandalous report called "The Armenian Connection" where it veraciously attacked human rights NGOs and research organisations criticising human rights violations and corruption in Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Russia.ESISC in that report asserted that "Caviar diplomacy" report elaborated by ESI aimed to create climate of suspicion based on slander to form a network of MPs that would engage in a political war against Azerbaijan."The report is written in the worst traditions of authoritarian propaganda, makes absurd claims, and is clearly aimed at deflecting the wave of criticism against cover-up of unethical lobbying and corruption in PACE and demands for change in the Assembly", said Freedom Files Analytical Centre.According Robert Coalson (Radio Free Europe), ESISC is a part of Baku's lobbying efforts to extend to the use of front think tanks to shift public opinion.European Stability Initiative said that "ESISC report is full of lies (such as claiming that German PACE member Strasser holds pro-Armenian views and citing as evidence that he went to Yerevan in 2015 to commemorate the Armenian genocide, when Strasser has never in his life been to independent Armenia)". </text>' </my-abstract>

Most Armenians are Christian, primarily of Apostolic Church rite. Armenia is considered the first nation to adopt Christianity, which was first preached in Armenia by two Apostles of Jesus, St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddeus in the 1st century.  The Armenian Apostolic Church can trace its roots back to the 3rd and 4th centuries.  The country formally adopted the Christian faith in 301 A.D. Over 90% of Armenians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the Coptic and Syrian churches. Armenia also has a population of Catholics and evangelical Protestants.
According to the Census of 2011 the religion in Armenia is the following: Christianity 2,862,366 (94.8%) of whom 2,797,187 Armenian Apostolic (92.5%), 29,280 Evangelical, 13,996 Armenian and Roman (Latin) Catholic, 8,695 Jehovah's Witness, 8,587 Eastern Orthodox (Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, Greek), 2,874 Molokan (non-Orthodox Russians), 1,733 Assyrian Church of the East (Nestorian), 733 Protestant, 241 Mormon, Yazidism (0.8%), Paganism (0.2%), 812 Islam, 5,299 Other Religion (0.2%), 121,587 No Response (4%).
According to 2019 UN data emigration rate averaged to annually 1.7 per 1000 inhabitants in years 2015–2020 and is expected to remain same until year 2045. These are below average emigration rate of 11.5 per 1000 in years 2000–2010 and even below the emigration rate of 3.2 per 1000 in years 1980–1985.

<my-abstract> The rates of emigration and population decline, however, have decreased in recent years, and there has been a moderate influx of Armenians returning to Armenia.[[File:Population armenia.png|thumb|450x450px|Population of Armenia 1950xe2x80x932010.<br/>Data NSSRA [http://www.armstat.am/en/] ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.|alt=]]According to 2018 HDI statistical update (with data for 2017) compared to all its neighboring countries Armenia has:2011 census counted 539 394 persons (19.4% of population above 6 years age) with higher professional education.During the Soviet period, life expectancy was traditionally high in Armenia and topped all other republics of USSR and most of countries in Eastern Europe in 1978xe2x80x931980.In 2016 natural increase of population comprised 12 366 persons and the crude rate of natural increase made 4.1xe2x80xb0, per 1000 population, decreasing by 0.4 pro mile points compared to the previous year.After double-digit (in pro mile) crude natural increase rates during 1982xe2x80x931992 these did not exceed 5.5 after 1998. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The government does not restrict internal or international travel.In December 2015, the country held a referendum which approved transformation of Armenia from a semi-presidential to a parliamentary republic.Skeptics saw the constitutional reform as an attempt of third president Serzh Sargsyan to remain in control by becoming Prime Minister after fulfilling his second presidential term in 2018.The unicameral National Assembly of Armenia (Azgayin Zhoghov) is the legislative branch of the government of Armenia.Before the 2015 Armenian constitutional referendum, it was initially made of 131 members, elected for five-year terms: 41 members in single-seat constituencies and 90 by proportional representation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In addition, the authors concluded that the most perspective product groups of Armenian export tend to be "Industrial products", "Food and beverages" and "Consumer goods".In 2010, EU countries accounted for 32.1 percent of Armenia's foreign trade.During Januaryxe2x80x93February 2007, Armenia's trade with the European Union totaled $200 million.In first quarter of 2019 share of Russia in foreign trade turnover fell to 11% from 29% in previous year.2017 CIS countries accounted for 30 percent of Armenia's foreign trade.Bilateral trade with Russia stood at more than $700 million for the first nine months of 2010 xe2x80x93 on track to rebound to $1 billion mark first reached in 2008 prior to the global economic crisis.During Januaryxe2x80x93February 2007, Armenia's trade with Russia and other former Soviet republics was $205.6 million (double the amount from the same period the previous year), making them the country's number one trading partner.In 2017 trade with China grew by 33.3 percent.As of early 2011, trade with China is dominated by imports of Chinese goods and accounts for about 10 percent of Armenia's foreign trade.The investment programs for these companies must still be approved by government.The Armenian Government approved the program to construct the Meghri free economic zone at the border with Iran, which is expected to open in 2017.Major monopolies in Armenia include:#Natural gas import and distribution, held by Gazprom Armenia, formerly named ArmRosGazprom (controlled by Russian monopoly Gazprom)# Armenia's railway, South Caucasus Railway, owned by Russian Railways (RZD)# Electricity transmission and distribution (see Electricity sector in Armenia)#Newspaper distribution, held by HaymamulFormer notable monopolies in Armenia :# Wireless (mobile) telephony, held by Armentel until 2004# Internet access, held by Armentel until September 2006# Fixed-line telephony, held by Armentel until August 2007Assumed (unofficial) monopolies until 2018 velvet revolution:#Oil import and distribution (claimed by Armenian opposition parties to belonging to a handful of government-linked individuals,)# Aviation kerosene (supplying to Zvartnots airport), held by Mika Limited# Various basic foodstuffs such as rice, sugar, wheat, cooking oil and butter).According to one analyst, Armenia's economic system in 2008 was anticompetitive due to the structure of the economy being a type of "monopoly or oligopoly".Despite the economic blockade of Turkey on Armenia, every day dozens of Turkish trucks laden with goods enter Armenia through Georgia.In 2010, it was confirmed that Turkey will keep the border closed for the foreseeable future after the Turkey-Armenia normalization process collapsed.According to 2018 HDI statistical update compared to its transcaucasian neighbouring countries Armenia had highest share of employed in services (49.7% of all employed) and lowest share of employed in agriculture (34.4% of all employed) .According to preliminary figures from Statistical Committee of Armenia monthly wages averaged to 172 thousand AMD in February 2019.It is estimated that wages rise at 0.8% for each additional year of experience and "the ability to solve problems and learn new skills yields a wage premium of nearly 20 percent".According to prime minister Nikol Pashinyan in January 2019 562,043 payroll jobs were recorded, against of 511,902 in January 2018, an increase of 9.7%.The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed economic system of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s.In the 2020 report of Index of Economic Freedom by Heritage Foundation, Armenia is classified as "mostly free" and ranks 34th, improving by 13 positions and ahead of all other Eurasian Economic Union countries and many EU countries including Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Belgium, Spain, France, Portugal and Italy.In the 2019 report (data for 2017) of Economic Freedom of the World published by Fraser Institute Armenia ranks 27th (classified most free) out of 162 economies.In the 2019 report of Global Competitiveness Index Armenia ranks 69th out of 141 economies.The first Soviet Armenian government regulated economic activity stringently, nationalising all economic enterprises, requisitioning grain from peasants, and suppressing most private market activity.The five enterprises which passed to 100 percent Russian state ownership are:In January 2003, the Armenian government and United Company RUSAL signed an investment cooperation agreement, under which United Company RUSAL (which already owned a 76% stake) acquired the Armenian government's remaining 26% share of RUSAL ARMENAL aluminum foil mill, giving RUSAL 100% ownership of RUSAL ARMENAL.On November 1, 2006, the Armenian government handed de facto control of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline to Russian company Gazprom and increased Gazprom's stake in the Russian-Armenian company ArmRosGazprom from 45% to 58% by approving an additional issue of shares worth $119 million.This decrease comes despite the fact that an important component of the government stimulus package was to support the completion of ongoing construction projects.In 2017 electricity generation increased by 6.1% reaching 7.8 billion KWh.In 2017 industrial output increased by 12.6% annually reaching 1661 billion AMD.Industrial output was relatively positive throughout 2010, with year-on-year average growth of 10.9 percent in the period January to September 2010, due largely to the mining sector where higher global demand for commodities led to higher prices.In the 2000s, along with the construction sector, the services sector was the driving force behind Armenia's recent high economic growth rate.In 2010, retail trade turnover was largely unaltered compared to 2009.Nowadays(2019), Armenia has improved standards of living and growing income, which brought to the improvement of retail sector in Armenia.The failure of market reforms, clan-based economics, and official corruption in Armenia have allowed the success of this process.In August 2002, the Armenian government sold an 80 percent stake in the Armenian Electricity Network (AEN) to Midland Resources, a British offshore-registered firm which is said to have close Russian connections.In September 2002, the Armenian government handed over Armenia's largest cement factory to the Russian ITERA gas exporter in payment for its $10 million debt for past gas deliveries.On November 5, 2002, Armenia transferred control of 5 state enterprises to Russia in an assets-for-debts transaction which settled $100 million of Armenian state debts to Russia.This suggests that tax collection in Armenia is improving at the expense of ordinary citizens, rather than wealthy citizens (who have been the main beneficiaries of Armenia's double-digit economic growth in recent years).According to the National Statistical Committee, in 2018, exports amounted to $2.411.9 billion, having grown by 7.8% from the previous year.According to the study [http://www.aea.am/files/papers/w1103.pdf REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF ARMENIA: PERSPECTIVES AND POTENTIALS] authors investigated the trade potential of Armenia for different product groups by employing a gravity model of trade approach. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The agreement envisages the two countries' interaction in exporting military production to third countries, which will help to strengthen the armed forces of the two states, and further cement the already close Russian-Armenian military cooperation.A Russian-Armenian defense agreement signed in August 2010 extends Russia's military presence in Armenia till 2044 and commits Russia to supplying Armenia with modern and compatible weaponry and special military hardware at reduced prices.In June 2013 it was revealed that Russia has deployed in Armenia several Iskander-M ballistic missiles systems, which are stationed at undisclosed locations in the country.On 7 October 2002, the Presidents of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan, signed a charter in Tashkent, founding the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) (Russian: xd0x9exd1x80xd0xb3xd0xb0xd0xbdxd0xb8xd0xb7xd0xb0xd1x86xd0xb8xd1x8f xd0x94xd0xbexd0xb3xd0xbexd0xb2xd0xbexd1x80xd0xb0 xd0xbe xd0x9axd0xbexd0xbbxd0xbbxd0xb5xd0xbaxd1x82xd0xb8xd0xb2xd0xbdxd0xbexd0xb9 xd0x91xd0xb5xd0xb7xd0xbexd0xbfxd0xb0xd1x81xd0xbdxd0xbexd1x81xd1x82xd0xb8 (xd0x9exd0x94xd0x9axd0x91~ODKB)) or simply xd0xa2xd0xb0xd1x88xd0xbaxd0xb5xd0xbdxd1x82xd1x81xd0xbaxd0xb8xd0xb9 xd0xb4xd0xbexd0xb3xd0xbexd0xb2xd0xbexd1x80 (The Tashkent Treaty).The largest-scale CSTO military exercise held, to date, were the "Rubezh 2008" exercises hosted in Armenia where a combined total of 4,000 troops from all 7 constituent CSTO member countries conducted operative, strategic, and tactical training with an emphasis towards furthering the efficiency of the collective security element of the CSTO partnership.The Ministry of Defense of Armenia has repeatedly stated that it would expect direct military assistance from the CSTO in case war with Azerbaijan resumes, as recently as December 2009, Defense Minister Ohanyan made the same statement.They become part of multinational military formations in compliance with international treaties Armenia is a signatory to, participate in the preparation of the population, the national economy and the maintenance of wartime reserves and the infrastructure of the country for defense.In times of crisis the Army's main tasks relate to participation in operations countering terrorist activities and defense of strategic facilities (such as nuclear power plants and major industrial facilities), assisting the security forces in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, illegal armaments traffic and international terrorism.In case of low- and medium-intensity military conflict the Active Forces that are part of the Army participate in carrying out the initial tasks for the defense of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The epistola de Re recta is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy; Anawati argues that it is by Avicenna, but written earlier in his career when he had not yet firmly decided that transmutation was impossible.Almost half of Avicenna's works are versified.From the depth of the black earth up to Saturn's apogee,All the problems of the universe have been solved by me.I have escaped from the coils of snares and deceits;I have unraveled all knots except the knot of Death.}}Robert Wisnovsky, a scholar of Avicenna attached to the McGill University, says that "Avicenna was the central figure in the long history of the rational sciences in Islam, particularly in the fields of metaphysics, logic and medicine" but that his works didn't only have an influence in these "secular" fields of knowledge alone, as "these works, or portions of them, were read, taught, copied, commented upon, quoted, paraphrased and cited by thousands of post-Avicennian scholars xe2x80x94 not only philosophers, logicians, physicians and specialists in the mathematical or exact sciences, but also by those who specialized in the disciplines of xcaxbfilm al-kalxc4x81m (rational theology, but understood to include natural philosophy, epistemology and philosophy of mind) and usxc5xabl al-fiqh (jurisprudence, but understood to include philosophy of law, dialectic, and philosophy of language).b'      DESCRIPTION: Medieval Persian polymath, physician and philosopher (c.980-1037).Ali Sina (activist)|Bu-Ali Sina University|Lenin Peak (mountain peak)}}{ }Ibn Sina (), also known as Abu Ali Sina (), Pur Sina (), and often known in the West as Avicenna (; & xe2x80x93 June 1037), was a Persian polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians, astronomers, thinkers and writers of the Islamic Golden Age,* His most famous works are The Book of Healing, a philosophical and scientific encyclopedia, and The Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopediaBesides philosophy and medicine, Avicenna's corpus includes writings on astronomy, alchemy, geography and geology, psychology, Islamic theology, logic, mathematics, physics and works of poetry.Avicenna argued that there must be a "necessary existent" (Arabic: wajib al-wujud), an entity that cannot not exist Present-day historian of philosophy Peter Adamson called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history of philosophy.Correspondence between Avicenna (with his student Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Ma'sumi) and Al-Biruni has survived in which they debated Aristotelian natural philosophy and the Peripatetic school.He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider epistemological matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.Later interpretations of Avicenna's philosophy split into three different schools; those (such as al-Tusi) who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as al-Razi) who considered Avicenna's theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as al-Ghazali) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means.e.g.Henry Corbin, History of Islamic Philosophy, Routledge, 2014, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=l9bgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA174 p. 174].Henry Corbin, Avicenna and the Visionary Recital, Princeton University Press, 2014, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=1P3_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 103].</ref>Avicenna's psychology and theory of knowledge influenced William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris and Albertus Magnus,Early Islamic philosophy and Islamic metaphysics, imbued as it is with Islamic theology, distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism between essence and existence. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> There have been 71 Ashes series: Australia have won 33, England 32 and six series have been drawn.The first Test match between England and Australia was played in Melbourne, Australia, in 1877, though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882.It won the first eight matches in succession including a 5xe2x80x930 whitewash in 1920xe2x80x931921 at the hands of Warwick Armstrong's team.The ruthless and belligerent Armstrong led his team back to England in 1921 where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of England without defeat.England won only one Test out of 15 from the end of the war until 1925.In a rain-hit series in 1926, England managed to eke out a 1xe2x80x930 victory with a win in the final Test at The Oval.A draw in the final Test gave England victory in an Ashes series for the first time in 18 years and their first Ashes victory at home since 1985.Australia regained the Ashes on its home turf in the 2006xe2x80x9307 series with a convincing 5xe2x80x930 victory, only the second time an Ashes series had been won by that margin.Despite losing a Test series 2xe2x80x931 in their tour of the West Indies,Test results, up to and including the 2019 Ashes series in England:Series results, up to and including the 2019 Ashes series:A team must win a series to gain the right to hold the Ashes.It stars Jack Warner as an England cricketer playing the last Test of his career, which is the last of an Ashes series; the film includes cameo appearances of English captain Len Hutton and other players who were part of England's 1953 triumph.Douglas Adams's 1982 science fiction comedy novel Life, the Universe and Everything xe2x80x93 the third part of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series xe2x80x93 features the urn containing the Ashes as a significant element of its plot.Before the 1989 series began, the win-loss ratio was almost even, with 87 test wins for Australia to England's 86, 74 tests having been drawn.The First Test at Lord's was convincingly won by Australia, but in the remaining four matches the teams were evenly matched and England fought back to win the Second Test by 2 runs, the smallest winning margin in Ashes history, and the second-smallest in all Tests. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It can be applied in the study of classical concepts of mathematics, such as real numbers, complex variables, trigonometric functions, and algorithms, or of non-classical concepts like constructivism, harmonics, infinity, and vectors.Florian Cajori explains in A History of Mathematics (1893) the difference between modern and ancient mathematical analysis, as distinct from logical analysis, as follows:The terms synthesis and analysis are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic.It has also been ascribed to Isaac Newton, in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name).The field of chemistry uses analysis in at least three ways: to identify the components of a particular chemical compound (qualitative analysis), to identify the proportions of components in a mixture (quantitative analysis), and to break down chemical processes and examine chemical reactions between elements of matter. </my-abstract>

<title>Amplitude modulation</title>
<wiki-abstract> Amplitude modulation (AM) is a modulation technique used in electronic communication, most commonly for transmitting messages with a radio carrier wave. In amplitude modulation, the amplitude (signal strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to that of the message signal, such as an audio signal. </wiki-abstract>

The simplest form of AM demodulator consists of a diode which is configured to act as envelope detector. Another type of demodulator, the product detector, can provide better-quality demodulation with additional circuit complexity.

<my-abstract> Single-sideband modulation uses bandpass filters to eliminate one of the sidebands and possibly the carrier signal, which improves the ratio of message power to total transmission power, reduces power handling requirements of line repeaters, and permits better bandwidth utilization of the transmission medium.AM remains in use in many forms of communication in addition to AM broadcasting: shortwave radio, amateur radio, two-way radios, VHF aircraft radio, citizens band radio, and in computer modems in the form of QAM.In electronics and telecommunications, modulation means varying some aspect of a continuous wave carrier signal with an information-bearing modulation waveform, such as an audio signal which represents sound, or a video signal which represents images.Amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for radio broadcasting until FM broadcasting began after World War 2.At the same time as AM radio began, telephone companies such as AT&T were developing the other large application for AM: sending multiple telephone calls through a single wire by modulating them on separate carrier frequencies, called frequency division multiplexing.John Renshaw Carson in 1915 did the first mathematical analysis of amplitude modulation, showing that a signal and carrier frequency combined in a nonlinear device would create two sidebands on either side of the carrier frequency, and passing the modulated signal through another nonlinear device would extract the original baseband signal. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> For the slit and the strip, he could not use the previously computed table of maxima and minima; for each combination of dimensions, the intensity had to be expressed in terms of sums or differences of Fresnel integrals and calculated from the table of integrals, and the extrema had to be calculated anew.Near the end of the memoir, Fresnel summed up the difference between Huygens's use of secondary waves and his own: whereas Huygens says there is light only where the secondary waves exactly agree, Fresnel says there is complete darkness only where the secondary waves exactly cancel out.The judging committee comprised Laplace, Biot, and Poisson (all corpuscularists), Gay-Lussac (uncommitted), and Arago, who eventually wrote the committee's report.The committee deliberated into the new year.But it was equally compatible with the wave theory, as Euler noted in 1746 xe2x80x93 tacitly assuming that the aether (the supposed wave-bearing medium) near the earth was not disturbed by the motion of the earth.The outstanding strength of Huygens's theory was his explanation of the birefringence (double refraction) of "Iceland crystal" (transparent calcite), on the assumption that the secondary waves are spherical for the ordinary refraction (which satisfies Snell's law) and spheroidal for the extraordinary refraction (which does not).Although Newton rejected the wave theory, he noticed its potential to explain colors, including the colors of "thin plates" (e.g., "Newton's rings", and the colors of skylight reflected in soap bubbles), on the assumption that light consists of periodic waves, with the lowest frequencies (longest wavelengths) at the red end of the spectrum, and the highest frequencies (shortest wavelengths) at the violet end.Fresnel's oldest and strongest point xe2x80x93 that thin crystals were subject to the same laws as thick ones and did not need or allow a separate theory xe2x80x93 Biot left unanswered.&  Arago and Fresnel were seen to have won the debate.Moreover, by this time Fresnel had a new, simpler explanation of his equations on chromatic polarization.In the draft memoir of 30 August 1816, Fresnel mentioned two hypotheses xe2x80x93 one of which he attributed to Ampxc3xa8re xe2x80x93 by which the non-interference of orthogonally-polarized beams could be explained if polarized light waves were partly transverse.In the same supplement, Fresnel reported his discovery that optical rotation could be emulated by passing the polarized light through a Fresnel rhomb (still in the form of "coupled prisms"), followed by an ordinary birefringent lamina sliced parallel to its axis, with the axis at 45xc2xb0 to the plane of reflection of the Fresnel rhomb, followed by a second Fresnel rhomb at 90xc2xb0 to the first.If the analyzer took the form of a thick calcite crystal with its axis in the plane of polarization, Fresnel predicted that the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary images of the lamina were respectively proportional towhere <math>i</math> is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the optic axis of the lamina, <math>s</math> is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the plane of polarization of the final ordinary image, and <math>phi</math> is the phase lag of the extraordinary wave relative to the ordinary wave due to the difference in propagation times through the lamina.The simpler dioptric (purely refractive) stepped lens, first proposed by Count Buffon and independently reinvented by Fresnel, is used in screen magnifiers and in condenser lenses for overhead projectors.By expressing Huygens's principle of secondary waves and Young's principle of interference in quantitative terms, and supposing that simple colors consist of sinusoidal waves, Fresnel gave the first satisfactory explanation of diffraction by straight edges, including the first satisfactory wave-based explanation of rectilinear propagation.Brewster, however, proposed a system similar to Condorcet's in 1811, and by 1820 was advocating its use in British lighthouses.Meanwhile, on 21 June 1819, Fresnel was temporarily seconded by the Commission des Phares (Commission of Lighthouses) on the recommendation of Arago (a member of the commission since 1813), to review possible improvements in lighthouse illumination.By the end of August 1819, unaware of the Buffon-Condorcet-Brewster proposal, Fresnel made his first presentation to the commission,(Fresnel acknowledged the British lenses and Buffon's invention in a memoir published in 1822.To reconcile his results with a sinusoidal oscillation, Biot had to suppose that the corpuscles emerged with one of two permitted orientations, namely the extremes of the oscillation, with probabilities depending on the phase of the oscillation.Early in 1814, reviewing Biot's work on chromatic polarization, Young noted that the periodicity of the color as a function of the plate thickness xe2x80x93 including the factor by which the period exceeded that for a reflective thin plate, and even the effect of obliquity of the plate (but not the role of polarization)xe2x80x94could be explained by the wave theory in terms of the different propagation times of the ordinary and extraordinary waves through the plate.In summary, in the spring of 1814, as Fresnel tried in vain to guess what polarization was, the corpuscularists thought that they knew, while the wave-theorists (if we may use the plural) literally had no idea. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot; sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions, known usually as dean (), but also as abbot (, , ).When the great reform of the 11th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots, the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families, as late as the 13th century and later, with the head of the community retaining the title of dean.John, patriarch of Antioch, at the beginning of the 12th Century, informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen, , for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.Giraldus Cambrensis reported (Itinerary, ii.iv) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century Church of Wales:In conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a prior.In the Roman Catholic Church, abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term (some orders of monks, as the Carthusians for instance, have no abbots, only priors). </my-abstract>

<title>Assembly line</title>
<wiki-abstract> An assembly line is a manufacturing process (often called a progressive assembly) in which parts (usually interchangeable parts) are added as the semi-finished assembly moves from workstation to workstation where the parts are added in sequence until the final assembly is produced. By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station, a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Henry Ford and others have written about the influence of this slaughterhouse practice on the later developments at Ford Motor Company.According to Domm, the implementation of mass production of an automobile via an assembly line may be credited to Ransom Olds, who used it to build the first mass-produced automobile, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash.At Ford Motor Company, the assembly line was introduced by William "Pa" Klann upon his return from visiting Swift & Company's slaughterhouse in Chicago and viewing what was referred to as the "disassembly line", where carcasses were butchered as they moved along a conveyor.These goals appear altruistic; however, it has been argued that they were implemented by Ford in order to reduce high employee turnover: when the assembly line was introduced in 1913, it was discovered that "every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963" in order to counteract the natural distaste the assembly line seems to have inspired.Sociological work has explored the social alienation and boredom that many workers feel because of the repetition of doing the same specialized task all day long.One of capitalism's most famous critics, Karl Marx, expressed in his Entfremdung theory the belief that in order to achieve job satisfaction workers need to see themselves in the objects they have created, that products should be "mirrors in which workers see their reflected essential nature." </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Piazzolla performed on the bandoneon, but his works are performed on either bandoneon or accordion.The earliest mention of the novel accordion instrument in Australian music occurs in the 1830s.The accordion initially competed against cheaper and more convenient reed instruments such as mouth organ, concertina and melodeon.Frank Fracchia was an Australian accordion composer are preserved in Australian libraries.Other Australian composers who arranged music for accordion include Reginald Stoneham.The popularity of the accordion peaked in the late 1930sThe accordion was particularly favoured by buskers.The accordion is a traditional instrument in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Some 2010s-era accordions may incorporate MIDI sensors and circuitry, enabling the accordion to be plugged into a synth module and produce accordion sounds or other synthesized instrument sounds, such as piano or organ.The accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or ethnic music, popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand.The size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single octave on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.The accordion is an aerophone.In some countries (for example Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama) it is used in popular music (for example Gaucho, Forrxc3xb3 and Sertanejo in Brazil, Vallenato in Colombia, and nortexc3xb1o in Mexico), whereas in other regions (such as Europe, North America and other countries in South America) it tends to be more used for dance-pop and folk music and is often used in folk music in Europe, North America and South America.In Europe and North America, some popular music acts also make use of the instrument. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> :# Whether artificial general intelligence is possible; whether a machine can solve any problem that a human being can solve using intelligence, or if there are hard limits to what a machine can accomplish.# Whether intelligent machines are dangerous; how humans can ensure that machines behave ethically and that they are used ethically.# Whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do; if a machine can be sentient, and thus deserve certain rights xe2x88x92 and if a machine can intentionally cause harm.;Alan Turing's "polite convention": One need not decide if a machine can "think"; one need only decide if a machine can act as intelligently as a human being.These authors use the term "computational intelligence" as a synonym for artificial intelligence.As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences., who make the analogy with aeronautical engineering.The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete "artificial neurons".The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, (and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human), a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,The development of metalxe2x80x93oxidexe2x80x93semiconductor (MOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI), in the form of complementary MOS (CMOS) transistor technology, enabled the development of practical artificial neural network (ANN) technology in the 1980s.John Haugeland named these symbolic approaches to AI "good old fashioned AI" or "GOFAI".Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.Economist Herbert Simon and Allen Newell studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive science, operations research and management science.Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as DeepMind and Vicarious to "just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence.The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI);Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the "Multivac" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name.However, onlookers commonly discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not "real" intelligence, with "real" intelligence being in effect defined as whatever behavior machines cannot do.Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to prevent harm and minimize the risks; they may have the ability to use ethical reasoning to better choose their actions in the world. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Karl Jaspers termed the intense period of philosophical development beginning around the 7th century and concluding around the 3rd century BCE an Axial Age in human thought.In Western philosophy, the spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire marked the ending of Hellenistic philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of medieval philosophy, whereas in Eastern philosophy, the spread of Islam through the Arab Empire marked the end of Old Iranian philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of early Islamic philosophy.Chinese philosophy is the dominant philosophical thought in China and other countries within the East Asian cultural sphere that share a common language, including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.The Hundred Schools of Thought were philosophers and schools that flourished from the 6th century to 221 BCE, an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in China.Some of the questions asked were:The six schools of Indian philosophy are:See also: Dualism, Dualism (philosophy of mind)While there are ancient relations between the Indian Vedas and the Iranian Avesta, the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view of man's role in the universe.But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the Chan sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the Zen sect.See also:  Christian philosophyThe ancient Indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions: the Vedic tradition and the Sramana tradition.Indian philosophy begins with the Vedas wherein questions pertaining to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, it is generally accepted that this quote is not Simplicius' own interpretation,   but Anaximander's writing, in "somewhat poetic terms" as it is mentioned by Simplicius.</ref>Whence things have their origin,<br />Thence also their destruction happens,<br />According to necessity;<br />For they give to each other justice and recompense<br />For their injustice<br />In conformity with the ordinance of Time.Simplicius mentions that Anaximander said all these "in poetic terms", meaning that he used the old mythical language.While each pre-Socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element (water for Thales and air for Anaximenes), Anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (apeiron), subject to neither old age nor decay, that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived.</blockquote>Anaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came (apeiron). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Health and safety risks form a vital part of the current design, and in many jurisdictions, design reports and records are required which include ongoing considerations such as materials and contaminants, waste management and recycling, traffic control and fire safety.Previously, architects employed drawings However, design may include the use of photos, collages, prints, linocuts, 3D scanning technology and other media in design production.The architect may introduce (intentionally or not), to greater or lesser degrees, aspects of mathematics and architecture, new or current architectural theory, or references to architectural history.A key part of the design is that the architect often consults with engineers, surveyors and other specialists throughout the design, ensuring that aspects such as the structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated in the scheme as a whole. </my-abstract>

<title>Abbreviation</title>
<wiki-abstract> An abbreviation (from Latin brevis, meaning short) is a shortened form of a word or phrase, by any method. It may consist of a group of letters, or words taken from the full version of the word or phrase; for example, the word abbreviation can itself be represented by the abbreviation abbr. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.To indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.When an abbreviation contains more than one full point, Hart's Rules recommends putting the s after the final one.However, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:According to Hart's Rules, an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.However, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:In Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking.Other uses are in company or product names such as Aldi, from the name of the founder, Theo Albrecht, and the German word Diskont (discount) or Haribo, from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, Hans Riegl Bonn.Syllabic abbreviations are more common in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as Pemex for Petrxc3xb3leos Mexicanos ("Mexican Petroleums") or Fonafifo for Fondo Nacional de Financimiento Forestal (National Forestry Financing Fund).In Southeast Asian languages, especially in Malay languages, syllabic abbreviations are also common; examples include Petronas (for Petroliam Nasional, "National Petroleum"), its Indonesian equivalent Pertamina (from its original name Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara, "State Oil and Natural Gas Mining Company"), and Kemenhub (from Kementerian Perhubungan, "Ministry of Transportation")East Asian languages whose writing systems use Chinese characters form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase.For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, "without an apostrophe".However, the 1999 style guide for The New York Times states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's".Following those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of run batted in, simply add an s to the end of RBI.For all other rules, see below:To form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase s to the end. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Fuller broke off his friendship and involvement with Crowley over the scandal, and Crowley and Neuburg returned to Algeria for further magical workings.The Equinox continued publishing, and various books of literature and poetry were also published under its imprint, like Crowley's Ambergris, The Winged Beetle, and The Scented Garden, as well as Neuburg's The Triumph of Pan and Ethel Archer's The Whirlpool.They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley's increasing interest in Western esotericism, a break-up that Crowley would regret for many years.In 1897, Crowley travelled to Saint Petersburg in Russia, later claiming that he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there.In October 1897, a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and "the futility of all human endeavour", and Crowley abandoned all thoughts of a diplomatic career in favour of pursuing an interest in the occult.Based on Desti's statements when in trance, Crowley wrote the two-volume Book 4 (1912xe2x80x9313) and at the time developed the spelling "magick" in reference to the paranormal phenomenon as a means of distinguishing it from the stage magic of illusionists.In early 1912, Crowley published The Book of Lies, a work of mysticism that biographer Lawrence Sutin described as "his greatest success in merging his talents as poet, scholar, and magus".Following the Paris Working, Neuburg began to distance himself from Crowley, resulting in an argument in which Crowley cursed him.By 1914 Crowley was living a hand-to-mouth existence, relying largely on donations from Axe2x88xb4Axe2x88xb4 members and dues payments made to O.T.O.Crowley described women as "moral inferiors" who had to be treated with "firmness, kindness and justice", while also arguing that Thelema was essential to women's emancipation.Biographers Richard B. Spence and Tobias Churton have suggested that Crowley was a spy for the British secret services and that among other things he joined the Golden Dawn under the command of them to monitor the activities of Mathers, who was known to be a Carlist. </my-abstract>

<title>Afterlife</title>
<wiki-abstract> The afterlife (also referred to as life after death or the world to come or reincarnation) is an existence some believe that the essential part of an individual's identity or their stream of consciousness continues to have after the death of their physical body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire soul or spirit, of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary nirvana. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> "When questioned by the Sadducees about the resurrection of the dead (in a context relating to who one's spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), Jesus said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be like the angels in heaven.Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the Son of God, and all who were in the tombs would come out, who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.The Book of Enoch describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in Paradise, the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.The Sadducees were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no afterlife.Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam, and many pagan belief systems, or reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.Reincarnation is the philosophical or religious concept that an aspect of a living being starts a new life in a different physical body or form after each death.His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as marriage in heaven (where all angels are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), time and space in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the eternity of Hell (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.The "Spiritual Combat", a written work by Lorenzo Scupoli, states that four assaults are attempted by the "evil one" at the hour of death.Some scholars also interpret the mention of reincarnation to be naturalistic akin to the biogeochemical cycles.But if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned in Guru Granth Sahib and in Dasam Granth, so from that it can be concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God.According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in Roman Egypt.The Greek god Hades is known in Greek mythology as the king of the underworld, a place where souls live after death.Charon, also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: Upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased's tongue.This ultimate goal is recited in one of the most prominent verses in Quraan, the first Sura in the Quraan, named Alfateha in the 5th verse "Ehdina al serata al mostaqeem" meaning "guide us to the straight path", and the following verses follows describing this path as "The way of those on whom you have bestowed your grace, not the way of those who earned your anger, nor of those who went astray".In the Quran, Allah gives warning about grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife (Akhirah),Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship God alone, which includes being kind to other human beings and life, including animals, and to trees, by not oppressing them. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> The Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game is a role-playing game created and written by Erick Wujcik, set in the fictional universe created by author Roger Zelazny for his Chronicles of Amber. The game is unusual in that no dice are used in resolving conflicts or player actions; instead a simple diceless system of comparative ability, and narrative description of the action by the players and gamemaster, is used to determine how situations are resolved. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a binary system, while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ternary system.An alloy is technically an impure metal, but when referring to alloys, the term impurities usually denotes undesirable elements.Because of this lack of understanding, steel was not generally considered an alloy until the decades between 1930 and 1970 (primarily due to the work of scientists like William Chandler Roberts-Austen, Adolf Martens, and Edgar Bain), so "alloy steel" became the popular term for ternary and quaternary steel-alloys.After Benjamin Huntsman developed his crucible steel in 1740, he began experimenting with the addition of elements like manganese (in the form of a high-manganese pig-iron called spiegeleisen), which helped remove impurities such as phosphorus and oxygen; a process adopted by Bessemer and still used in modern steels (albeit in concentrations low enough to still be considered carbon steel).Robert Forester Mushet found that by adding tungsten to steel it could produce a very hard edge that would resist losing its hardness at high temperatures. </my-abstract>

<title>Agrarianism</title>
<wiki-abstract> Agrarianism as a political and social philosophy relates to the ownership and use of land for farming, or to the part of a society or economy that is tied to agriculture. Agrarianism and agrarians will typically advocate on behalf of farmers and those in rural communities. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> While there are many schools of thought within agrarianism, historically a reoccurring feature of agrarians has been a commitment to egalitarianism, with agrarian political parties normally supporting the rights of small farmers and poor peasants against the wealthy in society.Some scholars suggest that agrarianism values rural society as superior to urban society and the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker, and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values.The philosophical roots of agrarianism include European and Chinese philosophers.Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965.In Latvia, the Union of Greens and Farmers is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms.In Lithuania, as of 2017, the government is led by the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, under the leadership of industrial farmer Ramxc5xabnas Karbauskis.In Poland, the Polish People's Party traces its tradition to an agrarian party in Austro-Hungarian-controlled Galician Poland.The relocation of the youths was originally intended to be permanent, but by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party relented and some of those who had the capacity to return to the cities were allowed to do so.In imitation of Mao's policies, the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia (who were heavily funded and supported by the People's Republic of China)Peasant parties first appeared across Eastern Europe between 1860 and 1910, when commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society, and the railway and growing literacy facilitated the work of roving organizers. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In 1837 Pierre Wantzel showed that for most angles this construction cannot be performed.In the Euclidean space, the angle xcexb8 between two Euclidean vectors u and v is related to their dot product and their lengths by the formulaThis formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes (or curved surfaces) from their normal vectors and between skew lines from their vector equations.To define angles in an abstract real inner product space, we replace the Euclidean dot product ( xc2xb7 ) by the inner product <math> langle cdot , cdot rangle </math>, i.e.In a complex inner product space, the expression for the cosine above may give non-real values, so it is replaced withor, more commonly, using the absolute value, withThe latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>operatorname{span}(mathbf{u})</math> and <math>operatorname{span}(mathbf{v})</math> spanned by the vectors <math>mathbf{u}</math> and <math>mathbf{v}</math> correspondingly.The definition of the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>operatorname{span}(mathbf{u})</math> and  <math>operatorname{span}(mathbf{v})</math> given byin a Hilbert space can be extended to subspaces of any finite dimensions.Where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may sometimes be referred to simply by its vertex (in this case "angle A").Potentially, an angle denoted as, say, xe2x88xa0BAC, might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C, the anticlockwise angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see Positive and negative angles).Each point is subdivided in four quarter-points so that 1 turn equals 128 quarter-points.;Hexacontade (n& =& 60): The hexacontade is a unit of 6xc2xb0 that Eratosthenes used, so that a whole turn was divided into 60 units.;Pechus (n& =& 144xe2x80x93180): The pechus was a Babylonian unit equal to about 2xc2xb0 or xc2xb0.;Binary degree (n& =& 256): The binary degree, also known as the binary radian (or brad), is  of a turn.;Degree (n& =& 360): The degree, denoted by a small superscript circle (xc2xb0), is 1/360 of a turn, so one turn is 360xc2xb0.As the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.Astronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.These measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough rule of thumb approximations only.The angle between a line and a curve (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the tangents at the point of intersection. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.ASL emerged as a language in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in 1817, ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.The influence of French Sign Language (LSF) on ASL is readily apparent; for example, it has been found that about 58% of signs in modern ASL are cognate to Old French Sign Language signs.Such languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries and are named accordingly, such as Nigerian Sign Language, Ghanaian Sign Language.In addition to the aforementioned West African countries, ASL is reported to be used as a first language in Barbados, Bolivia, Cambodia, the Central African Republic, Chad, China (Hong Kong), the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Jamaica, Kenya, Madagascar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Zimbabwe.Sign production can often vary according to location.York University psychologist Ellen Bialystok has also campaigned for bilingualism, arguing that those who are bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life.Although there is no well-established writing system for ASL,SignWriting, proposed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton, The SignWriting community has an open project on Wikimedia Labs to support the various Wikimedia projects on Wikimedia IncubatorSeveral additional candidates for written ASL have appeared over the years, including SignFont, ASL-phabet, and Si5s.For English-speaking audiences, ASL is often glossed using English words. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He saves the city from Islamic conquest, and even chases the Turks deeper into lands they had previously conquered.One of the earliest works of alternate history published in large quantities for the reception of a large audience may be Louis Geoffroy's Histoire de la Monarchie universelle: Napolxc3xa9on et la conquxc3xaate du monde (1812xe2x80x931832) (History of the Universal Monarchy: Napoleon and the Conquest of the World) (1836), which imagines Napoleon's First French Empire emerging victorious in the French invasion of Russia in 1811 and in an invasion of England in 1814, later unifying the world under Bonaparte's rule.In the English language, the first known complete alternate history is Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story "P.'s Correspondence", published in 1845.Rather than following the great man theory of history, focusing on leaders, wars, and major events, Robinson writes more about social history, similar to the Annales School of history theory and Marxist historiography, focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place.Philip Roth's novel, The Plot Against America (2004), looks at an America where Franklin D. Roosevelt is defeated in 1940 in his bid for a third term as President of the United States, and Charles Lindbergh is elected, leading to a US that features increasing fascism and anti-Semitism.Michael Chabon, occasionally an author of speculative fiction, contributed to the genre with his novel The Yiddish Policemen's Union (2007), which explores a world in which the State of Israel was destroyed in its infancy and many of the world's Jews instead live in a small strip of Alaska set aside by the US government for Jewish settlement.In Ward Moore's Bring the Jubilee, the protagonist lives in an alternate history in which the Confederacy has won the American Civil War; he travels backward through time, and brings about a Union victory in the Battle of Gettysburg.When a story's assumptions about the nature of time travel lead to the complete replacement of the visited time's future rather than just the creation of an additional time line, the device of a "time patrol" is often used where guardians move through time to preserve the "correct" history.A more recent example is Making History by Stephen Fry, in which a time machine is used to alter history so that Adolf Hitler was never born.Again, in the English Renaissance fantasy Armor of Light by Melissa Scott and Lisa A. Barnett, the magic used in the book, by Dr. John Dee and others, actually was practiced in the Renaissance; positing a secret history of effective magic makes this an alternate history with a POD, Sir Philip Sidney's surviving the Battle of Zutphen in 1586, and shortly thereafter saving the life of Christopher Marlowe.Many works of fantasy posit a world in which known practitioners of magic were able to make it function, and where the consequences of such reality would not, in fact, disturb history to such an extent as to make it plainly alternate history. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amine (–NH2) and carboxyl (–COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N), although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> "Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus)Following his work at Bell Labs in the US, Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY, a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London,According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, Dxc3xbcsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad Zuse.A day before the third anniversary of Morcom's death (13 February 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom: Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's atheism and materialism.|author=|title=|source=https://oldshirburnian.org.uk/alan-turing-and-the-nature-of-spirit/}}After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge,In 1936, Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem".In a letter to Morcom's mother, Frances Isobel Morcom (nxc3xa9e Swan), Turing wrote:</ref>}}Turing's relationship with Morcom's mother continued long after Morcom's death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom's birthdays.To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation.From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University,When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics.During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal.The circle has the largest area of any two-dimensional object having the same perimeter.A cyclic polygon (one inscribed in a circle) has the largest area of any polygon with a given number of sides of the same lengths.A version of the isoperimetric inequality for triangles states that the triangle of greatest area among all those with a given perimeter is equilateral.The triangle of largest area of all those inscribed in a given circle is equilateral; and the triangle of smallest area of all those circumscribed around a given circle is equilateral.The ratio of the area of the incircle to the area of an equilateral triangle, <math>frac{pi}{3sqrt{3}}</math>, is larger than that of any non-equilateral triangle.The ratio of the area to the square of the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, <math>frac{1}{12sqrt{3}},</math> is larger than that for any other triangle. </text>'Define the discriminant of f(x)-g(x) asBy simplifying the integral formula between the graphs of two functions (as given in the section above) and using Vieta's formula, we can obtainThe above remains valid if one of the bounding functions is linear instead of quadratic.The general formula for the surface area of the graph of a continuously differentiable function <math>z=f(x,y),</math> where <math>(x,y)in Dsubsetmathbb{R}^2</math> and <math>D</math> is a region in the xy-plane with the smooth boundary:An even more general formula for the area of the graph of a parametric surface in the vector form <math>mathbf{r}=mathbf{r}(u,v),</math> where <math>mathbf{r}</math> is a continuously differentiable vector function of <math>(u,v)in Dsubsetmathbb{R}^2</math> is:{| class="wikitable"-->The above calculations show how to find the areas of many common shapes.The areas of irregular polygons can be calculated using the "Surveyor's formula".The isoperimetric inequality states that, for a closed curve of length L (so the region it encloses has perimeter L) and for area A of the region that it encloses,and  equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle.Thus a circle has the largest area of any closed figure with a given perimeter.At the other extreme, a figure with given perimeter L could have an arbitrarily small area, as illustrated by a rhombus that is "tipped over" arbitrarily far so that two of its angles are arbitrarily close to 0xc2xb0 and the other two are arbitrarily close to 180xc2xb0.For a circle, the ratio of the area to the circumference (the term for the perimeter of a circle) equals half the radius r. This can be seen from the area formula xcfx80r<sup>2</sup> and the circumference formula 2xcfx80r.The area of a regular polygon is half its perimeter times the apothem (where the apothem is the distance from the center to the nearest point on any side).Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in).In 1842 the German mathematicians Carl Anton Bretschneider and Karl Georg Christian von Staudt independently found a formula, known as Bretschneider's formula, for the area of any quadrilateral.The development of Cartesian coordinates by Renxc3xa9 Descartes in the 17th century allowed the development of the surveyor's formula for the area of any polygon with known vertex locations by Gauss in the 19th century.The development of integral calculus in the late 17th century provided tools that could subsequently be used for computing more complicated areas, such as the area of an ellipse and the surface areas of various curved three-dimensional objects.For a non-self-intersecting (simple) polygon, the Cartesian coordinates <math>(x_i,  y_i)</math> (i=0, 1, ..., n-1) of whose n vertices are known, the area is given by the surveyor's formula:. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Along with improved measurements of the speed of light, these showed that Newcomb's values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another.The unit distance A (the value of the astronomical unit in metres) can be expressed in terms of other astronomical constants:where G is the Newtonian gravitational constant,  is the solar mass, k is the numerical value of Gaussian gravitational constant and D is the time period of one day.The Sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy,As the speed of light has an exact defined value in SI units and the Gaussian gravitational constant k is fixed in the astronomical system of units, measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product G in SI units.The solar parallax is related to the Earthxe2x80x93Sun distance as measured in Earth radii byThe smaller the solar parallax, the greater the distance between the Sun and Earth: a solar parallax of  is equivalent to an Earthxe2x80x93Sun distance of  Earth radii.Christiaan Huygens believed that the distance was even greater: by comparing the apparent sizes of Venus and Mars, he estimated a value of about  Earth radii, equivalent to a solar parallax of . </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Use of the word "artiste" can also be a pejorative term.The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.In Living with Art, Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:#arts consumers don't restrict themselves to either "high" or "common" arts; instead, they demonstrate "omnivorous tastes, liking both reggae and Rachmaninoff" (Peterson & Kern, 1996; Walker & Scott-Melnyk, 2002)#data indicates "artists are willing to move across sectors and no longer see working outside the commercial sector as a badge of distinction or authenticity" (Bridgstock, 2013; Ellmeier, 2003)#academic, policy, and government leaders are adaptingxe2x80x94wideningxe2x80x94programs & opportunities in recognition of "the role of artists as drivers of economic growth and innovation" (Bohm & Land, 2009; DCMS, 2006, 2008; Florida, 2012; Hesmondhalgh & Baker, 2010; Lloyd, 2010; Iyengar, 2013).#arts graduates name "business and management skills" as the "number one area [they] wish they had been more exposed to in college" (Strategic National Arts Alumni Project [SNAAP], 2011; Tepper & Kuh, 2010).The US Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies many visual artists as either craft artists or fine artists.Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the Renaissance in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-"art" activities, as wellxe2x80x94 law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among "artist" and "technician", "entertainer" and "artisan", "fine art" and "applied art", or what constitutes art and what does not. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international Anglican Communion, Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion or recognised by it also call themselves Anglican, including those that are within the Continuing Anglican movement and Anglican realignment.Anglicans base their Christian faith on the Bible, traditions of the apostolic Church, apostolic succession ("historic episcopate"), and the writings of the Church Fathers.These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them, Thomas Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and others as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions, namely Lutheranism and Calvinism.In the first half of the 17th century, the Church of England and its associated Church of Ireland were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition, with theologies, structures, and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way, or via media, between Protestantism and Catholicism xe2x80x93 a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as "Catholic and Reformed".When the Union with Ireland Act created the United Church of England and Ireland, it is specified that it shall be one "Protestant Episcopal Church", thereby distinguishing its form of church government from the Presbyterian polity that prevails in the Church of Scotland.The word Episcopal is preferred in the title of the Episcopal Church (the province of the Anglican Communion covering the United States) and the Scottish Episcopal Church, though the full name of the former is The Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America.The 2007xe2x80x9308 Directory of Traditional Anglican and Episcopal Parishes, published by the Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen, contained information on over 900 parishes affiliated with either the Continuing Anglican churches or the Anglican realignment movement, a more recent wave of Anglicans withdrawing from the Anglican Communion's North American provinces.A concern for social justice can be traced to very early Anglican beliefs, relating to an intertwined theology of God, nature, and humanity.The Book is acknowledged as a principal tie that binds the Anglican Communion together as a liturgical rather than a confessional tradition or one possessing a magisterium as in the Roman Catholic Church.After the American Revolution, Anglican congregations in the United States and British North America (which would later form the basis for the modern country of Canada) were each reconstituted into autonomous churches with their own bishops and self-governing structures; these were known as the American Episcopal Church and the Church of England in the Dominion of Canada.Others have, at various times, joined the Continuing Anglican movement.The term "Continuing Anglicanism" refers to a number of church bodies which have formed outside of the Anglican Communion in the belief that traditional forms of Anglican faith, worship, and order have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some Anglican Communion churches in recent decades.Consequently, the conclusion of the War of Independence eventually resulted in the creation of two new Anglican churches, the Episcopal Church in the United States in those states that had achieved independence; and in the 1830s The Church of England in Canada became independent from the Church of England in those North American colonies which had remained under British control and to which many Loyalist churchmen had migrated.Reluctantly, legislation was passed in the British Parliament (the Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786) to allow bishops to be consecrated for an American church outside of allegiance to the British Crown (since no dioceses had ever been established in the former American colonies).The great Church of England missionary societies were founded; for example, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) in 1698, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) in 1701, and the Church Mission Society (CMS) in 1799.The 19th century saw the founding and expansion of social-oriented evangelism with societies such as the Church Pastoral Aid Society (CPAS) in 1836, Mission to Seafarers in 1856, Girls' Friendly Society (GFS) in 1875, Mothers' Union in 1876, and Church Army in 1882, all carrying out a personal form of evangelism.The 20th century saw the Church of England developing new forms of evangelism such as the Alpha course in 1990, which was developed and propagated from Holy Trinity Brompton Church in London. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The slaves were forced to work on the sugar plantations which had begun to replace tobacco as Anguilla's main crop.During the early colonial period, Anguilla was administered by the British through Antigua; in 1825, it was placed under the administrative control of nearby Saint Kitts.Full adult suffrage was introduced to Anguilla in 1952. and Ronald Webster amongst others, became known as the Anguillian Revolution; its goal was not independence per se, but rather independence from Saint Kitts and Nevis and a return to being a British colony.With negotiations failing to break the deadlock, a second referendum confirming Anguillians' desire for separation from St Kitts was held and the Republic of Anguilla was declared unilaterally, with Ronald Webster as president.The native Arawak name for the island was Malliouhana.Precisely when Anguilla was first seen by Europeans is uncertain: some sources claim that Columbus sighted the island during his second voyage in 1493, while others state that the first European explorer was the French Huguenot nobleman and merchant Renxc3xa9 Goulaine de Laudonnixc3xa8re in 1564.Traditional accounts state that Anguilla was first colonised by English settlers from Saint Kitts beginning in 1650.More recently, a Muslim cultural centre has opened on the island.Today most people in Anguilla speak a British-influenced variety of standard English.There are six government primary schools, one government secondary school (Albena Lake Hodge Comprehensive School), and two private schools.There is a University of the West Indies Open campus site in the island.The Anguilla National Trust (ANT) was established in 1988 and opened its offices in 1993 charged with the responsibility of preserving the heritage of the island, including its cultural heritage.As throughout the Caribbean, holidays are a cultural fixture. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> See acoustics for the engineering approach.For sound waves of any magnitude of a disturbance in velocity, pressure, and density we have  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdot mathbf{v} + ablacdot(rho'mathbf{v}) & = 0  qquad text{(Conservation of Mass)}      (rho_0+rho')frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + (rho_0+rho')(mathbf{v}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + abla p' & = 0  qquad text{(Equation of Motion)}  end{align}In the case that the fluctuations in velocity, density, and pressure are small, we can approximate these as  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdot mathbf{v} & = 0      frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + frac{1}{rho_0}abla p'& = 0  end{align}Where <math>mathbf{v}(mathbf{x},t)</math> is the perturbed velocity of the fluid, <math>p_0</math> is the pressure of the fluid at rest, <math>p'(mathbf{x},t)</math> is the perturbed pressure of the system as a function of space and time, <math>rho_0</math> is the density of the fluid at rest, and <math>rho'(mathbf{x}, t)</math> is the variance in the density of the fluid over space and time.In the case that the velocity is irrotational (<math>ablatimes mathbf{v} = 0</math>), we then have the acoustic wave equation that describes the system:   frac{1}{c^2}frac{partial^2 phi}{partial t^2} - abla^2phi = 0 </math>Where we havebegin{align}   mathbf{v} & = -abla phi c^2 & = (frac{partial p}{partial rho})_sp' & = rho_0frac{partial phi}{partial t}rho' & = frac{rho_0}{c^2}frac{partial phi}{partial t}end{align} </math>Starting with the Continuity Equation and the Euler Equation:  begin{align}     frac{partial rho}{partial t} +ablacdot rhomathbf{v} & = 0      rhofrac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + rho(mathbf{v}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + abla p & = 0  end{align}If we  take small perturbations of a constant pressure and density:  begin{align}     rho & = rho_0+rho'      p & = p_0 + p'  end{align}Then the equations of the system are  begin{align}     frac{partial}{partial t}(rho_0+rho') +ablacdot (rho_0+rho')mathbf{v} & = 0      (rho_0+rho')frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + (rho_0+rho')(mathbf{v}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + abla (p_0+p') & = 0  end{align}Noting that the equilibrium pressures and densities are constant, this simplifies to  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdotmathbf{v}+ablacdot rho'mathbf{v} & = 0      (rho_0+rho')frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + (rho_0+rho')(mathbf{v}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + abla p' & = 0  end{align}Starting with  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdotmathbf{w}+ablacdot rho'mathbf{w} & = 0      (rho_0+rho')frac{partial mathbf{w}}{partial t} + (rho_0+rho')(mathbf{w}cdotabla)mathbf{w} + abla p' & = 0  end{align}We can have these equations work for a moving medium by setting <math>mathbf{w} = mathbf{u} + mathbf{v}</math>, where <math>mathbf{u}</math> is the constant velocity that the whole fluid is moving at before being disturbed (equivalent to a moving observer) and <math>mathbf{v}</math> is the fluid velocity.In this case the equations look very similar:  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdotmathbf{v}+mathbf{u}cdotablarho' + ablacdot rho'mathbf{v} & = 0      (rho_0+rho')frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + (rho_0+rho')(mathbf{u}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + (rho_0+rho')(mathbf{v}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + abla p' & = 0  end{align}Note that setting <math>mathbf{u} = 0</math> returns the equations at rest.Starting with the above given equations of motion for a medium at rest:  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdotmathbf{v}+ablacdot rho'mathbf{v} & = 0      (rho_0+rho')frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + (rho_0+rho')(mathbf{v}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + abla p' & = 0  end{align}Let us now take <math>mathbf{v},rho',p'</math> to all be small quantities.In the case that we keep terms to first order, for the continuity equation, we have the <math>rho'mathbf{v}</math> term going to 0.Again, starting with  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdotmathbf{v}+mathbf{u}cdotablarho' + ablacdot rho'mathbf{v} & = 0      (rho_0+rho')frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + (rho_0+rho')(mathbf{u}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + (rho_0+rho')(mathbf{v}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + abla p' & = 0  end{align}We can linearize these into  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdotmathbf{v}+mathbf{u}cdotablarho' & = 0      frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + (mathbf{u}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + frac{1}{rho_0}abla p' & = 0  end{align}Given that we saw that  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdotmathbf{v}+mathbf{u}cdotablarho' & = 0      frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + (mathbf{u}cdotabla)mathbf{v} + frac{1}{rho_0}abla p' & = 0  end{align}If we make the previous assumptions of the fluid being ideal and the velocity being irrotational, then we have  begin{align}     p' & = (frac{partial p}{partial rho_0})_srho' = c^2rho'      mathbf{v} & = -ablaphi  end{align}Under these assumptions, our linearized sound equations become  begin{align}     frac{1}{c^2}frac{partial p'}{partial t} -rho_0abla^2phi+frac{1}{c^2}mathbf{u}cdotabla p' & = 0      -frac{partial}{partial t}(ablaphi) - (mathbf{u}cdotabla)[ablaphi] + frac{1}{rho_0}abla p' & = 0  end{align}Importantly, since <math>mathbf{u}</math> is a constant, we have <math>(mathbf{u}cdotabla)[ablaphi] = abla[(mathbf{u}cdotabla)phi]</math>, and then the second equation tells us that  frac{1}{rho_0} abla p' = abla[frac{partialphi}{partial t} + (mathbf{u}cdotabla)phi]Or just that  p' = rho_0[frac{partialphi}{partial t} + (mathbf{u}cdotabla)phi]Now, when we use this relation with the fact that <math>frac{1}{c^2}frac{partial p'}{partial t} -rho_0abla^2phi+frac{1}{c^2}mathbf{u}cdotabla p' = 0</math>, alongside cancelling and rearranging terms, we arrive at  frac{1}{c^2}frac{partial^2 phi}{partial t^2} - abla^2phi + frac{1}{c^2}frac{partial}{partial t}[(mathbf{u}cdotabla)phi] + frac{1}{c^2}frac{partial}{partial t}(mathbf{u}cdotablaphi) + frac{1}{c^2}mathbf{u}cdotabla[(mathbf{u}cdotabla)phi] = 0We can write this in a familiar form as[frac{1}{c^2}(frac{partial}{partial t} + mathbf{u}cdotabla)^2-abla^2]phi = 0This differential equation must be solved with the appropriate boundary conditions.We thus have, upon rearranging the equilibrium density:  begin{align}     frac{partial rho'}{partial t} +rho_0ablacdot mathbf{v} & = 0      frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + frac{1}{rho_0}abla p' & = 0  end{align}Next, given that our sound wave occurs in an ideal fluid, the motion is adiabatic, and then we can relate the small change in the pressure to the small change in the density by  p' = (frac{partial p}{partial rho_0})_srho'Under this condition, we see that we now have  begin{align}     frac{partial p'}{partial t} +rho_0(frac{partial p}{partial rho_0})_sablacdot mathbf{v} & = 0      frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + frac{1}{rho_0}abla p' & = 0  end{align}Defining the speed of sound of the system:c equiv sqrt{(frac{partial p}{partial rho_0})_s}Everything becomes  begin{align}     frac{partial p'}{partial t} +rho_0c^2ablacdot mathbf{v} & = 0      frac{partial mathbf{v}}{partial t} + frac{1}{rho_0}abla p' & = 0  end{align}In the case that the fluid is irrotational, that is <math>ablatimesmathbf{v} = 0</math>, we can then write <math>mathbf{v} = -ablaphi</math> and thus write our equations of motion as  begin{align}     frac{partial p'}{partial t} -rho_0c^2abla^2phi & = 0      -ablafrac{partialphi}{partial t} + frac{1}{rho_0}abla p' & = 0  end{align}The second equation tells us that  p' = rho_0 frac{partial phi}{partial t}And the use of this equation in the continuity equation tells us that     rho_0frac{partial^2 phi}{partial t} -rho_0c^2abla^2phi = 0This simplifies to     frac{1}{c^2}frac{partial^2 phi}{partial t^2} -abla^2phi = 0Thus the velocity potential <math>phi</math> obeys the wave equation in the limit of small disturbances.The boundary conditions required to solve for the potential come from the fact that the velocity of the fluid must be 0 normal to the fixed surfaces of the system.Taking the time derivative of this wave equation and multiplying all sides by the unperturbed density, and then using the fact that <math>p' = rho_0 frac{partial phi}{partial t}</math> tells us that     frac{1}{c^2}frac{partial^2 p'}{partial t^2} -abla^2p' = 0Similarly, we saw that <math>p' = (frac{partial p}{partial rho_0})_srho' = c^2rho'</math>.Regardless, upon solving this equation for a moving medium, we then havebegin{align}   mathbf{v} & = -abla phi p' & = rho_0(frac{partial}{partial t} + mathbf{u}cdotabla)phirho' & = frac{rho_0}{c^2}(frac{partial}{partial t} + mathbf{u}cdotabla)phiend{align} </math>"In particular, we have  begin{align}     mathbf{v} & = -abla phi      p' & = rho_0 frac{partial phi}{partial t}rho' & = frac{rho_0}{c^2}frac{partialphi}{partial t}  end{align}Again, we can derive the small-disturbance limit for sound waves in a moving medium.Thus we can multiply the above equation appropriately and see that     frac{1}{c^2}frac{partial^2 rho'}{partial t^2} -abla^2rho' = 0Thus, the velocity potential, pressure, and density all obey the wave equation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Another evidence of Ashoka's connection to the city may be the name of the Dharmarajika Stupa near Taxila; the name suggests that it was built by Ashoka ("Dharma-raja").The story about the deities miraculously bringing weapons to Ashoka may be the text's way of deifying Ashoka; or of indicating that Bindusara xe2x80x93 who disliked Ashoka xe2x80x93 wanted him to fail in Takshashila.According to the Mahavamsa, Bindusara appointed Ashoka as the viceroy of present-day Ujjain (Ujjeni), which was an important administrative and commercial centre in the Avanti province of central India.This indicates to us that Ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures, and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls.|source=}}It is possible, but not certain, that Ashoka received letters from Greek rulers and was acquainted with the Hellenistic royal orders in the same way as he perhaps knew of the inscriptions of the Achaemenid kings, given the presence of ambassadors of Hellenistic kings in India (as well as the dxc3xbctas sent by Ashoka himself).The Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as Dharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek (Yona) Buddhist monks, active in spreading Buddhism (the Mahavamsa, XII).Some Greeks (Yavana) may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by Ashoka.Numismatic research suggests that this symbol was the symbol of king Ashoka, his personal "Mudra".Caduceus on Mauryan coin.jpg | Caduceus symbol on a Maurya-era punch-marked coinIndia Mauryan emperor Ashoka Punch-marked Coin.jpg | A punch-marked coin attributed to Ashoka}}Since then, the association of "Devanampriya Priyadarsin" with Ashoka was confirmed through various inscriptions, and especially confirmed in the Minor Rock Edict inscription discovered in Maski, directly associating Ashoka with his regnal title Devanampriya ("Beloved-of-the-Gods"):}}Another important historian was British archaeologist John Hubert Marshall, who was director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India.Taranatha also states that Ashoka was initially called "Kamashoka" because he spent many years in pleasurable pursuits (kama); he was then called "Chandashoka" ("Ashoka the fierce"), because he spent some years performing extremely wicked deeds; and finally, he came to be known as Dhammashoka ("Ashoka the righteous") after his conversion to Buddhism.The Ashokavadana also calls him "Chandashoka", and describes several of his cruel acts:The 5th century Chinese traveller Faxian states that Ashoka personally visited the underworld to study the methods of torture there, and then invented his own methods.Another possibility is the Kalinga war and its consequences, as described in Ashoka's rock edicts, are "more imaginary than real": this description is meant to impress those far removed from the scene, and thus, unable to verify its accuracy.Ancient sources do not mention any other military activity of Ashoka, although the 16th century writer Taranatha claims that Ashoka conquered the entire Jambudvipa.Different sources give different accounts of Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism.According to Sri Lankan tradition, Ashoka's father Bindusara was a devotee of Brahmanism, and his mother Dharma was a devotee of Ajivikas.The date of the Buddha's death is itself a matter of debate, and the North Indian tradition states that Ashoka ruled a hundred years after the Buddha's death, which has led to further debates about the date.Assuming that the Sri Lankan tradition is correct, and assuming that the Buddha died in 483 BCE xe2x80x93 a date proposed by several scholars xe2x80x93 Ashoka must have ascended the throne in 265 BCE.The Indica is a lost work, and only parts of it survive in form of paraphrases in later writings.The 12th-century text Rajatarangini mentions a Kashmiri king Ashoka of Gonandiya dynasty who built several stupas: some scholars, such as Aurel Stein, have identified this king with the Maurya king Ashoka; others, such as Ananda W. P. Guruge dismiss this identification as inaccurate.Alternative interpretation of the epigraphic evidenceFor some scholars such as Christopher I. Beckwith, Ashoka, whose name only appears in the Minor Rock Edicts, should be differentiated from the ruler Piyadasi, or Devanampiya Piyadasi (i.e.Next, with Moggaliputta-Tissa's help, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to distant regions such as Kashmir, Gandhara, Himalayas, the land of the Yonas (Greeks), Maharashtra, Suvannabhumi, and Sri Lanka.The Sri Lankan tradition dates these missions to Ashoka's 18th regnal year, naming the following missionaries:The tradition adds that during his 19th regnal year, Ashoka's daughter Sanghamitta went to Sri Lanka to establish an order of nuns, taking a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree with her.The North Indian tradition makes no mention of these events. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The term  is used almost exclusively for the whole continent, and the U.S. is called  ("United States") or  ("United States of America"), often abbreviated .The Getting Through Customs website advises business travelers not to use "in America" as a U.S. reference when conducting business in Brazil.The entry for "America" in The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage from 1999 reads:Media releases from the Pope and Holy See frequently use "America" to refer to the United States, and "American" to denote something or someone from the United States.At least one international law uses U.S. citizen in defining a citizen of the United States rather than American citizen; for example, the English version of the North American Free Trade Agreement includes:Many international treaties use the terms American and American citizen:Products that are labeled, advertised, and marketed in the U.S. as "Made in the USA" must be, as set by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), "all or virtually all made in the U.S." The FTC, to prevent deception of customers and unfair competition, considers an unqualified claim of "American Made" to expressly claim exclusive manufacture in the U.S: "The FTC Act gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A task that is requeued is blocked and added to the queue of the target entry; this means that the protected object is released and allows admission of another task.The select statement in Ada can be used to implement non-blocking entry calls and accepts, non-deterministic selection of entries (also with guards), time-outs and aborts.The following example illustrates some concepts of concurrent programming in Ada.with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;procedure Traffic is   type Airplane_ID is range 1..10;             -- 10 airplanes   task type Airplane (ID: Airplane_ID);        -- task representing airplanes, with ID as initialisation parameter   type Airplane_Access is access Airplane;     -- reference type to Airplane   protected type Runway is                     -- the shared runway (protected to allow concurrent access)      entry Assign_Aircraft (ID: Airplane_ID);  -- all entries are guaranteed mutually exclusive      entry Cleared_Runway (ID: Airplane_ID);      entry Wait_For_Clear;   private      Clear: Boolean := True;                   -- protected private data - generally more than only a flag...   end Runway;   type Runway_Access is access all Runway;   -- the air traffic controller task takes requests for takeoff and landing   task type Controller (My_Runway: Runway_Access) is      -- task entries for synchronous message passing      entry Request_Takeoff (ID: in Airplane_ID; Takeoff: out Runway_Access);      entry Request_Approach(ID: in Airplane_ID; Approach: out Runway_Access);   end Controller;   --  allocation of instances   Runway1    : aliased Runway;              -- instantiate a runway   Controller1: Controller (Runway1'Access); -- and a controller to manage it   ------ the implementations of the above types ------   protected body Runway is      entry Assign_Aircraft (ID: Airplane_ID) when Clear is   -- the entry guard - calling tasks are blocked until the condition is true      begin       Clear := False;       Put_Line (Airplane_ID'Image (ID) & " on runway ");      end;      entry Cleared_Runway (ID: Airplane_ID) when not Clear is      begin         Clear := True;         Put_Line (Airplane_ID'Image (ID) & " cleared runway ");      end;      entry Wait_For_Clear when Clear is      begin         null;      -- no need to do anything here - a task can only enter if "Clear" is true      end;   end Runway;   task body Controller is   begin      loop         My_Runway.Wait_For_Clear;   -- wait until runway is available (blocking call)         select                      -- wait for two types of requests (whichever is runnable first)            when Request_Approach'count = 0 =>  -- guard statement - only accept if there are no tasks queuing on Request_Approach             accept Request_Takeoff (ID: in Airplane_ID; Takeoff: out Runway_Access)             do                                 -- start of synchronized part               My_Runway.Assign_Aircraft (ID);  -- reserve runway (potentially blocking call if protected object busy or entry guard false)               Takeoff := My_Runway;            -- assign "out" parameter value to tell airplane which runway             end Request_Takeoff;               -- end of the synchronised part         or            accept Request_Approach (ID: in Airplane_ID; Approach: out Runway_Access) do               My_Runway.Assign_Aircraft (ID);               Approach := My_Runway;            end Request_Approach;         or                          -- terminate if no tasks left who could call            terminate;         end select;      end loop;   end;   task body Airplane is      Rwy : Runway_Access;   begin      Controller1.Request_Takeoff (ID, Rwy); -- This call blocks until Controller task accepts and completes the accept block      Put_Line (Airplane_ID'Image (ID) & "  taking off...");      delay 2.0;      Rwy.Cleared_Runway (ID);               -- call will not block as "Clear" in Rwy is now false and no other tasks should be inside protected object      delay 5.0; -- fly around a bit...      loop         select   -- try to request a runway            Controller1.Request_Approach (ID, Rwy); -- this is a blocking call - will run on controller reaching accept block and return on completion            exit; -- if call returned we're clear for landing - leave select block and proceed...         or            delay 3.0;  -- timeout - if no answer in 3 seconds, do something else (everything in following block)            Put_Line (Airplane_ID'Image (ID) & "   in holding pattern");  -- simply print a message         end select;      end loop;      delay 4.0;  -- do landing approach...

Friday;   -- Days to workWork_Load: constant array(Working_Day) of Working_Hours  -- implicit type declaration   := (Friday => 6, Monday => 4, others => 10);           -- lookup table for working hours with initializationTypes can have modifiers such as limited, abstract, private etc.");      Rwy.Cleared_Runway (ID);  -- notify runway that we're done here.   end;   New_Airplane: Airplane_Access;begin   for I in Airplane_ID'Range loop  -- create a few airplane tasks      New_Airplane := new Airplane (I); -- will start running directly after creation      delay 4.0;   end loop;end Traffic;A pragma is a compiler directive that conveys information to the compiler to allow specific manipulating of compiled output."The first validated Ada implementation was the NYU Ada/Ed translator,By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ada compilers had improved in performance, but there were still barriers to fully exploiting Ada's abilities, including a tasking model that was different from what most real-time programmers were used to.Because of Ada's safety-critical support features, it is now used not only for military applications, but also in commercial projects where a software bug can have severe consequences, e.g., avionics and air traffic control, commercial rockets such as the Ariane 4 and 5, satellites and other space systems, railway transport and banking.For example, the Airplane Information Management System, the fly-by-wire system software in the Boeing 777, was written in Ada.The language became an ANSI standard in 1983 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20040625113309/http://archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/Welcome.html ANSI/MIL-STD 1815A]), and after translation in French and without any further changes in English becamean ISO standard in 1987 (ISO-8652:1987).This version of the language is commonly known as Ada& 83, from the date of its adoption by ANSI, but is sometimes referred to also as Ada& 87, from the date of its adoption by ISO.Ada& 95, the joint ISO/ANSI standard ([http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TTL.html ISO-8652:1995]) was published in February 1995, making Ada& 95 the first ISO standard object-oriented programming language.The Jargon File, a dictionary of computer hacker slang originating in 1975xe2x80x931983, notes in an [http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg262.txt entry on Ada] that "it is precisely what one might expect given that kind of endorsement by fiat; designed by committee...difficult to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar boondoggle...Ada Lovelace...would almost certainly blanch at the use her name has been latterly put to; the kindest thing that has been said about it is that there is probably a good small language screaming to get out from inside its vast, {elephantine} bulk.If the control flow of the task reaches an accept statement, the task is blocked until the corresponding entry is called by another task (similarly, a calling task is blocked until the called task reaches the corresponding accept statement). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> AES requires a separate 128-bit round key block for each round plus one more.# Initial round key addition:## each byte of the state is combined with a byte of the round key using bitwise xor.# 9, 11 or 13 rounds:## a non-linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to a lookup table.## a transposition step where the last three rows of the state are shifted cyclically a certain number of steps.## a linear mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.## # Final round (making 10, 12 or 14 rounds in total):## ## ## In the  step, each byte in the state is replaced with its entry in a fixed 8-bit lookup table, S; b).In the  step, each byte <math>a_{i,j}</math> in the state array is replaced with a  <math>S(a_{i,j})</math> using an 8-bit substitution box.Together with ,  provides diffusion in the cipher.During this operation, each column is transformed using a fixed matrix (matrix left-multiplied by column gives new value of column in the state):begin{bmatrix}b_{0,j}  b_{1,j}  b_{2,j}  b_{3,j}end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix}2 & 3 & 1 & 1 1 & 2 & 3 & 1 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 3 & 1 & 1 & 2end{bmatrix} begin{bmatrix}a_{0,j}  a_{1,j}  a_{2,j}  a_{3,j}end{bmatrix}qquad 0 le j le 3Matrix multiplication is composed of multiplication and addition of the entries.The S-box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points (and so is a derangement), i.e., <math> S(a_{i,j}) eq a_{i,j} </math>, and also any opposite fixed points, i.e., <math> S(a_{i,j}) oplus a_{i,j} eq text{FF}_{16} </math>.While performing the decryption, the  step (the inverse of ) is used, which requires first taking the inverse of the affine transformation and then finding the multiplicative inverse.In the  step, bytes in each row of the state are shifted cyclically to the left.Most AES calculations are done in a particular finite field.For instance, 16 bytes, <math>b_0, b_1, ..., b_{15}</math> are represented as this two-dimensional array:begin{bmatrix}b_0 & b_4 & b_8 & b_{12} b_1 & b_5 & b_9 & b_{13} b_2 & b_6 & b_{10} & b_{14} b_3 & b_7 & b_{11} & b_{15}end{bmatrix}The key size used for an AES cipher specifies the number of transformation rounds that convert the input, called the plaintext, into the final output, called the ciphertext. </my-abstract>

<title>Anisotropy</title>
<wiki-abstract> Anisotropy () is the property of a material which allows it to change or assume different properties in different directions as opposed to isotropy. It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity, tensile strength, etc. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.In fluorescence spectroscopy, the fluorescence anisotropy, calculated from the polarization properties of fluorescence from samples excited with plane-polarized light, is used, e.g., to determine the shape of a macromolecule.Anisotropy measurements reveal the average angular displacement of the fluorophore that occurs between absorption and subsequent emission of a photon.Images of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity (vertical and horizontal).Physicists from University of California, Berkeley reported about their detection of the cosine anisotropy in cosmic microwave background radiation in 1977.Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earth's crust, mantle and inner core.Geological formations with distinct layers of sedimentary material can exhibit electrical anisotropy; electrical conductivity in one direction (e.g. </my-abstract>

<title>Alpha decay</title>
<wiki-abstract> Alpha decay or α-decay is a type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle (helium nucleus) and thereby transforms or 'decays' into a different atomic nucleus, with a mass number that is reduced by four and an atomic number that is reduced by two. An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a helium-4 atom, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. </wiki-abstract>

<title>Extreme poverty</title>
<wiki-abstract> Extreme poverty, deep poverty, abject poverty, absolute poverty, destitution, or penury, is the most severe type of poverty, defined by the United Nations (UN) as "a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income but also on access to services" (UN 1995 report of the World Summit for Social Development)United Nations. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Citing the close correlation between economic growth and the reduction of poverty in poor countries, Annan urged international leaders to indiscriminately target the problem of extreme poverty across every region.Overall, there has been significant progress towards reducing extreme poverty, with the MDG1 target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half being met five years early, representing 700 million people being lifted out of extreme poverty from 1990 to 2010, with 1.2 billion people still remaining under those conditions.Joseph Wresinski, founder of the International Movement ATD Fourth World, distinguishing "lack of basic security" (poverty) and "chronic poverty" (extreme poverty), linking the eradication of extreme poverty by allowing people currently experiencing it a real opportunity to exercise all their human rights:"The lack of basic security connotes the absence of one or more factors enabling individuals and families to assume basic responsibilities and to enjoy fundamental rights.Despite the significant number of individuals still below the international poverty line, these figures represent significant progress for the international community, as they reflect a decrease of more than one billion people over 15 years.In public opinion surveys around the world, people surveyed tend to incorrectly think that extreme poverty has not decreased.The reduction of extreme poverty and hunger was the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG1), as set by the United Nations in 2000. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbage's difference engine a design for a simpler mechanical computer.The Analytical Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.During this project, Babbage realised that a much more general design, the Analytical Engine, was possible.In recognition of her additions to Menabrea's paper, which included a way to calculate Bernoulli numbers using the machine (widely considered to be the first complete computer program), she has been described as the first computer programmer.Late in his life, Babbage sought ways to build a simplified version of the machine, and assembled a small part of it before his death in 1871.In 1878, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science described the Analytical Engine as "a marvel of mechanical ingenuity", but recommended against constructing it. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status.With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws that would assign him the province of Cisalpine Gaul.In the face of Octavian's large and capable force, Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome and, to the relief of the Senate, he left Rome for Cisalpine Gaul, which was to be handed to him on 1 January.At the urging of Cicero, the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on 1 January 43& BC, yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls.The senate heaped many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than on Octavian for defeating Antony, then attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus.In a meeting near Bologna in October 43& BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate.Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was most responsible for the proscriptions and killing.Drusus's marriage to Augustus's niece Antonia was considered an unbreakable affair, whereas Vipsania was "only" the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.Tiberius shared in Augustus's tribune powers as of 6& BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to Rhodes.After the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9& BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew Germanicus.The only other possible claimant as heir was Postumus Agrippa, who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7, his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him.A temporary peace agreement was reached in 39& BC with the treaty of Misenum; the blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and the Peloponnese, and ensured him a future position as consul for 35& BC.The territorial agreement between the triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on 17 January 38& BC.In supporting Octavian, Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against the Parthian Empire, desiring to avenge Rome's defeat at Carrhae in 53& BC.Octavian and Lepidus launched a joint operation against Sextus in Sicily in 36& BC.Lepidus surrendered to Octavian and was permitted to retain the office of Pontifex Maximus (head of the college of priests), but was ejected from the Triumvirate, his public career at an end, and effectively was exiled to a villa at Cape Circei in Italy.Meanwhile, Antony's campaign turned disastrous against Parthia, tarnishing his image as a leader, and the mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces.Roman troops captured the Kingdom of Armenia in 34& BC, and Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia.The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an autocrat.The Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift (1667xe2x80x931745), in his Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome, criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed Great Britain's virtuous constitutional monarchy to Rome's moral Republic of the 2nd century BC.First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul.A second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the "Marcus Primus Affair".Such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermathxe2x80x94i.e., before Augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maiusxe2x80x94as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus.However, though some of his contemporaries did,Octavian could not rely on his limited funds to make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy.A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds took no action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate's arch enemy Mark Antony.Octavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesar's veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar.Arriving in Rome on 6 May 44& BC, Octavian found consul Mark Antony, Caesar's former colleague, in an uneasy truce with the dictator's assassins.This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire.During the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a tribune (tribunicia potestas) for life, though not the official title of tribune.This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting.With the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum.Augustus was granted sole imperium within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The canonical process took place with believers recognizing writings as being inspired by God from known or accepted origins, subsequently being followed by official affirmation of what had become largely established through the study and debate of the writings.The Eastern Orthodox Church accepts a few more books than appear in the Catholic canon.The actual status of the books which the Catholic church terms Deuterocanonicals (second canon) and Protestantism refers to as Apocrypha has been an issue of disagreement which preceded the Reformation.Others argue that the Septuagint of the first century did not contain these books but were added later by Christians, and some also contain books classed as pseudepigrapha, from which texts were cited by some early writers in the second and later centuries as being scripture.While a few scholars conclude that the Jewish canon was the achievement of the Hasmonean dynasty, or somewhat later, at which time considerations of Greek language and beginnings of Christian acceptance of the Septuagint weighed against some of the texts. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The support of the USSR and Chile to the Argentine proposal finally caused the United States to retract its opposition.The signing of the treaty was the first arms control agreement that occurred in the framework of the Cold War, and the complaining countries managed to avoid the internationalization of Antarctic sovereignty.The provisions of the present treaty shall apply to the area south of 60-degree South Latitude, including all ice shelves, but nothing in the present treaty shall prejudice or in any way affect the rights, or the exercise of the rights, of any State under international law with regard to the high seas within that area.The Antarctic Treaty System's yearly Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM) are the international forum for the administration and management of the region.On July 15, 1955, the Chilean Government rejected the jurisdiction of the Court in that case, and on August 1, the Argentine Government also did so, so on March 16, 1956, the claims were filed.On September 2, 1947, the American quadrant of Antarctica (between 24 xc2xb0 W and 90 xc2xb0 W) was included as part of the security zone of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, committing its members to defend it in case of external aggression.In August 1948, the United States proposed that Antarctica be under the guardianship of the United Nations as a trust administered by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, United States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. </my-abstract>

<title>Arminianism</title>
<wiki-abstract> Arminianism is a branch of Protestantism based on the theological ideas of the Dutch Reformed theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560–1609) and his historic supporters known as Remonstrants. His teachings held to the five solae of the Reformation, but they were distinct from particular teachings of Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and other Protestant Reformers. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> These articles asserted that# Salvation (and condemnation on the day of judgment) was conditioned by the graciously enabled faith (or unbelief) of man;# The Atonement is qualitatively adequate for all men, "yet that no one actually enjoys [experiences] this forgiveness of sins, except the believer ..." and thus is limited to only those who trust in Christ;# "That man has not saving grace of himself, nor of the energy of his free will", and unaided by the Holy Spirit, no person is able to respond to God's will;# The (Christian) Grace "of God is the beginning, continuance, and accomplishment of any good", yet man may resist the Holy Spirit; and# Believers are able to resist sin through Grace, and Christ will keep them from falling; but whether they are beyond the possibility of ultimately forsaking God or "becoming devoid of grace ... must be more particularly determined from the Scriptures."The core beliefs of Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrants are summarized as such by theologian Stephen Ashby:#Prior to being drawn and enabled, one is unable to believexe2x80xa6 able only to resist.#Having been drawn and enabled, but prior to regeneration, one is able to believexe2x80xa6 able also to resist.#After one believes, God then regenerates; one is able to continue believingxe2x80xa6 able also to resist.#Upon resisting to the point of unbelief, one is unable again to believexe2x80xa6 able only to resist.John Wesley has historically been the most influential advocate for the teachings of Arminian soteriology.Later General Baptists such as John Griffith, Samuel Loveday, and Thomas Grantham defended a Reformed Arminian theology that reflected more the Arminianism of Arminius than that of the later Remonstrants or the English Arminianism of Arminian Puritans like John Goodwin or Anglican Arminians such as Jeremy Taylor and Henry Hammond. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The monks of the Abbey lived in a house built against the north wall of the church.The whole of the southern and western areas of the Abbey were devoted to workshops, stables and farm-buildings including stables, ox-sheds, goatstables, piggeries, and sheep-folds, as well as the servants' and labourers' quarters.In the eastern part of the Abbey there was a group of buildings representing in layout, two complete miniature monasteries.The head abbey in England was at Welbeck Abbey but the best preserved are Easby Abbey in Yorkshire, and Bayham Old Abbey in Kent.The lay out of Easby Abbey is irregular due to its position on the edge of a steep river bank.Shrewsbury Abbey in Shropshire was founded as a Benedictine monastery by the Normans in 1083.Westminster Abbey was founded in the tenth century by Saint Dunstan who established a community of Benedictine monks.The cloister and buildings lie directly to the south of the church. </my-abstract>

<title>Annales school</title>
<wiki-abstract> The Annales school () is a group of historians associated with a style of historiography developed by French historians in the 20th century to stress long-term social history. It is named after its scholarly journal Annales d'histoire économique et sociale, which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: l'histoire quasi immobile (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (la longue durxc3xa9e), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.While authors such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Marc Ferro and Jacques Le Goff continue to carry the Annales banner, today the Annales approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in cultural history, political history and economic history.Bloch's Les Rois Thaumaturges (1924) looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure scrofula by his thaumaturgic touch.The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by Roger Chartier (1945xe2x80x93 ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the cultural and linguistic turn, which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.  The main scholarly outlet has been the journal Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale ("Annals of Economic and Social History"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. </my-abstract>

<title>Antimatter</title>
<wiki-abstract> In modern physics, antimatter is defined as matter which is composed of the antiparticles (or "partners") of the corresponding particles of "ordinary" matter. Minuscule numbers of antiparticles are generated daily at particle accelerators – total production has been only a few nanograms – and in natural processes like cosmic ray collisions and some types of radioactive decay, but only a tiny fraction of these have successfully been bound together in experiments to form anti-atoms. </wiki-abstract>

<title>Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</title>
<wiki-abstract> | acts amended= </wiki-abstract>

<headings> 
See also US labor law and .
The ADA states that a "covered entity" shall not discriminate against "a qualified individual with a disability".
Prohibited discrimination may include, among other things, firing or refusing to hire someone based on a real or perceived disability, segregation, and harassment based on a disability. Covered entities are also required to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants and employees with disabilities.
There are many ways to discriminate against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, she or he is not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.
Part of Title I was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court as it pertains to states in the case of Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett as violating the sovereign immunity rights of the several states as specified by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules. State employees can, however, file complaints at the Department of Justice or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, who can sue on their behalf.Title III—public accommodations (and commercial facilities) , 
Title IV of the ADA amended the landmark Communications Act of 1934 primarily by adding section . This section requires that all telecommunications companies in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, it led to the installation of public teletypewriter (TTY) machines and other TDD (telecommunications devices for the deaf). Title IV also led to the creation, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, of what was then called dual-party relay services and now are known as Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS), such as STS relay. Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are Video Relay Service (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.

Title V includes technical provisions. It discusses, for example, the fact that nothing in the ADA amends, overrides or cancels anything in Section 504. Additionally, Title V includes an anti-retaliation or coercion provision. The Technical Assistance Manual for the ADA explains this provision: 
 , 
The ADA has roots in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
 , 
In 1986, the National Council on Disability (NCD), an independent federal agency, issued a report, Towards Independence, in which the Council examined incentives and disincentives in federal laws towards increasing the independence and full integration of people with disabilities into our society. Among the disincentives to independence the Council identified was the existence of large remaining gaps in our nation's civil rights coverage for people with disabilities. A principal conclusion of the report was to recommend the adoption of comprehensive civil rights legislation, which became the ADA.
 , 
Over the years, key activists and advocates played an important role in lobbying members of the U.S. Congress to develop and pass the ADA, including Justin Whitlock Dart Jr., Patrisha Wright and others.
Ms. Wright is known as "the General" for her work in coordinating the campaign to enact the ADA.
 , 
 , 
About the importance of making employment opportunities inclusive, Shirley Davis, director of global diversity and inclusion at the Society for Human Resource Management, said: "People with disabilities represent a critical talent pool that is underserved and underutilized".
 , 
The debate over the Americans with Disabilities Act led some religious groups to take opposite positions. The cost argument advanced by ACSI and others prevailed in keeping religious institutions from being labeled as "public accommodations".
Church groups such as the National Association of Evangelicals testified against the ADA's Title I employment provisions on grounds of religious liberty. The NAE believed the regulation of the internal employment of churches was "... an improper intrusion [of] the federal government."
 , 
Many members of the business community opposed the Americans with Disabilities Act. Testifying before Congress, Greyhound Bus Lines stated that the act had the potential to "deprive millions of people of affordable intercity public transportation and thousands of rural communities of their only link to the outside world." The US Chamber of Commerce argued that the costs of the ADA would be "enormous" and have "a disastrous impact on many small businesses struggling to survive." Pro-business conservative commentators,,
 joined in opposition, writing that the Americans with Disabilities Act was "an expensive headache to millions" that would not necessarily improve the lives of people with disabilities.
 , 
Shortly before the act was passed, disability rights activists with physical disabilities coalesced in front of the Capitol Building, shed their crutches, wheelchairs, powerchairs and other assistive devices, and immediately proceeded to crawl and pull their bodies up all 100 of the Capitol's front steps, without warning.
George H. W. Bush, on signing the measure on July 26, 1990, said:
 , 
The ADA defines a covered disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a history of having such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment. The EEOC developed regulations limiting an individual's impairment to one that "severely or significantly restricts" a major life activity. The ADAAA directed the EEOC to amend its regulations and replace "severely or significantly" with "substantially limits", a more lenient standard.
On September 25, 2008, President George W. Bush signed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) into law. The amendment broadened the definition of "disability", thereby extending the ADA's protections to a greater number of people. The ADAAA also added to the ADA examples of "major life activities" including, but not limited to, "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working" as well as the operation of several specified major bodily functions.
In 2008, the United States House Committee on Education and Labor stated that the amendment "makes it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability."
On July 20, 2015, the White House held a reception to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the ADA. The introductory remarks were given by Haben Girma, a deafblind disability rights lawyer and advocate.

In October, 2019, the Supreme Court declined to resolve a circuit split as to whether websites are covered by the ADA. The Court turned down an appeal from Domino's Pizza and let stand a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling [https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-10-07/blind-person-dominos-ada-supreme-court-disabled which held that] the Americans With Disabilities Act protects access not just brick-and-mortar public accommodations, but also to the websites and apps of those businesses.

The ADA has been criticized on the grounds that it decreases the employment rate for people with disabilities
In 2001, for men of all working ages and women under 40, Current Population Survey data showed a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers, leading at least two economists to attribute the cause to the Act.
 , 
Since enforcement of the act began in July 1992, it has quickly become a major component of employment law. The ADA allows private plaintiffs to receive only injunctive relief (a court order requiring the public accommodation to remedy violations of the accessibility regulations) and attorneys' fees, and does not provide monetary rewards to private plaintiffs who sue non-compliant businesses. Unless a state law, such as the California Unruh Civil Rights Act,
 , 
There have been some notable cases regarding the ADA. For example, two major hotel room marketers (Expedia.com and Hotels.com) with their business presence on the Internet were sued because its customers with disabilities could not reserve hotel rooms, through their websites without substantial extra efforts that persons without disabilities were not required to perform. These represent a major potential expansion of the ADA in that this, and other similar suits (known as "bricks vs. clicks"), seeks to expand the ADA's authority to cyberspace, where entities may not have actual physical facilities that are required to comply.

National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation
 , 
Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett was a United States Supreme Court case about Congress's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It decided that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed private citizens to sue states for money damages.

Barden v. The City of Sacramento, filed in March 1999, claimed that the City of Sacramento failed to comply with the ADA when, while making public street improvements, it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the ADA. Certain issues were resolved in Federal Court. One issue, whether sidewalks were covered by the ADA, was appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that sidewalks were a "program" under ADA and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities. The ruling was later appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case, letting stand the ruling of the 9th Circuit Court.

Bates v. UPS (begun in 1999) was the first equal opportunity employment class action brought on behalf of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (d/Deaf/HoH) workers throughout the country concerning workplace discrimination. It established legal precedence for d/Deaf/HoH Employees and Customers to be fully covered under the ADA. Key findings included
# UPS failed to address communication barriers and to ensure equal conditions and opportunities for deaf employees;
# Deaf employees were routinely excluded from workplace information, denied opportunities for promotion, and exposed to unsafe conditions due to lack of accommodations by UPS;
# UPS also lacked a system to alert these employees as to emergencies, such as fires or chemical spills, to ensure that they would safely evacuate their facility; and
# UPS had no policy to ensure that deaf applicants and employees actually received effective communication in the workplace.
The outcome was that UPS agreed to pay a $5.8 million award and agreed to a comprehensive accommodations program that was implemented in their facilities throughout the country.

Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd. was a case that was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 2005. The defendant argued that as a vessel flying the flag of a foreign nation it was exempt from the requirements of the ADA. This argument was accepted by a federal court in Florida and, subsequently, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the lower courts on the basis that Norwegian Cruise Lines was a business headquartered in the United States whose clients were predominantly Americans and, more importantly, operated out of port facilities throughout the United States.

Olmstead v. L.C. was a case before the United States Supreme Court in 1999. The two plaintiffs L.C. and E.W. were institutionalized in Georgia for diagnosed mental retardation and schizophrenia. Clinical assessments by the state determined that the plaintiffs could be appropriately treated in a community setting rather than the state institution. The plaintiffs sued the state of Georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the state's community based treatment facilities.
The Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA that mental illness is a form of disability and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it "...perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life." The court added, "Confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment."
Therefore, under Title II no person with a disability can be unjustly excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs or activities of any public entity.

This was a case filed before The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division on behalf of the Michigan Paralyzed Veterans of America against University of Michigan – Michigan Stadium claiming that Michigan Stadium violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its $226-million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms, concessions and parking. Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas. The U.S. Department of Justice assisted in the suit filed by attorney Richard Bernstein of The Law Offices of Sam Bernstein in Farmington Hills, Michigan, which was settled in March 2008.
 , 
One of the first major ADA lawsuits, Paralyzed Veterans of America v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers (PVA 1996) was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase, MCI Center (now known as Capital One Arena) in Washington, D.C. Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces. While Section 4.33.3 of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons. The MCI Center, designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects & Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing. This case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ADA enforcement that continues to present day.

Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, held that even requests for accommodation that might seem reasonable on their face, e.g., a transfer to a different position, can be rendered unreasonable because it would require a violation of the company's seniority system.  While the court held that, in general, a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable, a plaintiff can present evidence that, despite the seniority system, the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand, e.g., the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority system is so often disregarded that another exception wouldn't make a difference.
Importantly, the court held that the defendant need not provide proof that this particular application of the seniority system should prevail, and that, once the defendant showed that the accommodation violated the seniority system, it fell to Barnett to show it was nevertheless reasonable.
In this case, Barnett was a US Airways employee who injured his back, rendering him physically unable to perform his cargo-handling job.  Invoking seniority, he transferred to a less-demanding mailroom job, but this position later became open to seniority-based bidding and was bid on by more senior employees.  Barnett requested the accommodation of being allowed to stay on in the less-demanding mailroom job.  US Airways denied his request, and he lost his job.
The Supreme Court decision invalidated both the approach of the district court, which found that the mere presence and importance of the seniority system was enough to warrant a summary judgment in favor of US Airways, as well as the circuit court's approach that interpreted 'reasonable accommodation' as 'effective accommodation.'
 , 
Access Now v. Southwest Airlines was a case where the District Court decided that the website of Southwest Airlines was not in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, because the ADA is concerned with things with a physical existence and thus cannot be applied to cyberspace. Judge Patricia A. Seitz found that the "virtual ticket counter" of the website was a virtual construct, and hence not a "public place of accommodation." As such, "To expand the ADA to cover 'virtual' spaces would be to create new rights without well-defined standards."
 , 
Ouellette v. Viacom International Inc. followed in Access Now's footsteps by holding that a mere online presence does not subject a website to the ADA guidelines. Thus Myspace and YouTube were not liable for a dyslexic man's inability to navigate the site regardless of how impressive the "online theater" is.
 , 
Authors Guild v. HathiTrust was a case in which the District Court decided that the HathiTrust digital library was a transformative, fair use of copyrighted works, making a large number of written text available to those with print disability.
 , 
Zamora-Quezada v. HealthTexas Medical Group was filed by Texas attorney Robert Provan against five HMOs for their practice of revoking the contracts of doctors treating disabled patients.
 , 
Campbell v. General Dynamics Government Systems Corp. (2005) concerned the enforceability of a mandatory arbitration agreement, contained in a dispute resolution policy linked to an e-mailed company-wide announcement, insofar as it applies to employment discrimination claims brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
 , 
Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004), was a case in the Supreme Court of the United States involving Congress's enforcement powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. George Lane was unable to walk after a 1997 car accident in which he was accused of driving on the wrong side of the road. A woman was killed in the crash, and Lane faced misdemeanor charges of reckless driving. The suit was brought about  because he was denied access to appear in criminal court because the courthouse had no elevator, even though the court was willing to carry him up the stairs and then willing to move the hearing to the first floor. He refused, citing he wanted to be treated as any other citizen, and was subsequently charged with failure to appear, after appearing at a previous hearing where he dragged himself up the stairs.

There are a number of open questions regarding the ADA, with scholars and courts alike trying to solve them. For example, one scholar has argued that the "deliberate indifference model" should apply to ADA Title II damages actions[https://scholarship.law.tamu.edu/lawreview/vol7/iss1/8/ Fifth Indifference: Clarifying the Fifth Circuit's Intent Standard for Damages Under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act]. Indeed, there are some very powerful provisions of the ADA (especially Title II) that appear to go unnoticed or under used.

<my-abstract> The jaws are lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an herbivorous diet.Like those of other sauropods, the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck.The limb bones are also very robust.The first Apatosaurus bones were discovered by Edward Drinker Cope and the name Apatosaurus ajax was coined in 1877 by Copexe2x80x99s rival Othniel Charles Marsh, Professor of Paleontology at Yale University, based on a nearly complete skeleton (holotype, YPM1860) discovered in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Gunnison County, Colorado.Another specimen, in the American Museum of Natural History under specimen number460, which is occasionally assigned to Apatosaurus, is considered nearly complete; only the head, feet, and sections of the tail are missing, and it was the first sauropod skeleton mounted.Despite Riggs' publication, Henry Fairfield Osborn, who was a strong opponent of Marsh and his taxa, labeled the Apatosaurus mount of the American Museum of Natural History Brontosaurus.3018 mounted with a cast of skull CM11162]]It was not until 1909 that an Apatosaurus skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would become known as the Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument.More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now thought to have been fully terrestrial animals.A 2015 study of the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many differences between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may have shown that the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat.Trackways of sauropods like Apatosaurus show that they may have had a range of around  per day, and that they could potentially have reached a top speed of  per hour.Diplodocids like Apatosaurus are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees.A few specimens indicate a maximum length of 11xe2x80x9330% greater than average and a mass of .The cervical vertebrae of Apatosaurus are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of Diplodocus, a diplodocid like Apatosaurus, and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that Apatosaurus was a more robust animal. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> ]]The Andes can be divided into three sections:; The Southern Andes: in Argentina and Chile, south of Llullaillaco.; The Central Andes: in Peru and Bolivia.; The Northern Andes: in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.The Bolivian Orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of South America and the Andes Mountains at about 18xc2xb0 S. Near the southern tip of the Andes lies the Patagonian Orocline.The western rim of the South American Plate has been the place of several pre-Andean orogenies since at least the late Proterozoic and early Paleozoic, when several terranes and microcontinents collided and amalgamated with the ancient cratons of eastern South America, by then the South American part of Gondwana.The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the Triassic when Pangaea began the break up that resulted in developing several rifts.It is at between  in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to  in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30xc2xb0S before descending to  on Aconcagua at 32xc2xb0S,  at 40xc2xb0S,  at 50xc2xb0S, and only  in Tierra del Fuego at 55xc2xb0S; from 50xc2xb0S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level.The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones: the Dry Andes and the Wet Andes. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Large plate anchors such as the Stevmanta are used for permanent moorings.The elements of anchoring gear include the anchor, the cable (also called a rode), the method of attaching the two together, the method of attaching the cable to the ship, charts, and a method of learning the depth of the water.Vessels may carry a number of anchors: bower anchors (formerly known as sheet anchors ) are the main anchors used by a vessel and normally carried at the bow of the vessel.The Viking Ladby ship (probably 10th century) used a fluked anchor of this type, made entirely of iron.An Admiralty Pattern anchor; when deployed on the seafloor the stock forces one of its flukes into the bottomThe Admiralty Pattern anchor, or simply "Admiralty", also known as a "Fisherman", consists of a central shank with a ring or shackle for attaching the rode (the rope, chain, or cable connecting the ship and the anchor).Some modern anchors, such as the Ultra will hold with a scope of 3:1; but, unless the anchorage is crowded, a longer scope will always reduce shock stresses.Since all anchors that embed themselves in the bottom require the strain to be along the seabed, anchors can be broken out of the bottom by shortening the rope until the vessel is directly above the anchor; at this point the anchor chain is "up and down", in naval parlance.A swivel is attached to the middle of the anchor cable, and the vessel connected to that.The vessel will now swing in the middle of two anchors, which is acceptable in strong reversing currents, but a wind perpendicular to the current may break out the anchors, as they are not aligned for this load.Also known as tandem anchoring, in this technique two anchors are deployed in line with each other, on the same rode. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Dryden in MacFlecknoe disdainfully called the pastime the "torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways".Thy genius calls thee not to purchase fameIn keen iambics, but mild anagram:Leave writing plays, and choose for thy commandSome peaceful province in acrostic land.There thou may'st wings display and altars raise,And torture one poor word ten thousand ways."Eleanor Audeley", wife of Sir John Davies, is said to have been brought before the High Commission in 1634 for extravagances, stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to "Reveale, O Daniel", and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by Sir John Lambe, the dean of the Arches, "Dame Eleanor Davies", "Never soe mad a ladie".An example from France was a flattering anagram for Cardinal Richelieu, comparing him to Hercules or at least one of his hands (Hercules being a kingly symbol), where Armand de Richelieu became Ardue main d'Hercule ("difficult hand of Hercules").Examples from the 19th century are the transposition of "Horatio Nelson" into Honor est a Nilo (Latin: Honor is from the Nile); and of "Florence Nightingale" into "Flit on, cheering angel".With the advent of surrealism as a poetic movement, anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the Baroque period.Upon confirming his observations, three years later he revealed it to mean  (Latin: It [Saturn] is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic).When Robert Hooke discovered Hooke's law in 1660, he first published it in anagram form, , for  (Latin: as the extension, so the force).In a related use, from 1975, British naturalist Sir Peter Scott coined the scientific term  (Greek: The monster (or wonder) of Ness with the diamond-shaped fin) for the apocryphal Loch Ness Monster.Anagrams are connected to pseudonyms, by the fact that they may conceal or reveal, or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity.For example:They can sometimes change from a proper noun or personal name into an appropriate sentence:They can change part of speech, such as the adjective "silent" to the verb "listen"."Anagrams" itself can be anagrammatized as "Ars magna" (Latin, 'the great art').Anagrams can be traced back to the time of the ancient Greeks, and were then known as Themuru or 'changing', which was to find the hidden and mystical meaning in names.They were popular throughout Europe during the Middle Ages, for example with the poet and composer Guillaume de Machaut.Any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Violent reactions have also been reported with acetaldehyde, hypochlorite solutions, potassium ferricyanide and peroxides.Ammonia is one of the most produced inorganic chemicals, with global production reported at 175 million tonnes in 2018.Before the start of World War I, most ammonia was obtained by the dry distillationFor small scale laboratory synthesis, one can heat urea and calcium hydroxide:Mass production of ammonia mostly uses the Haberxe2x80x93Bosch process, a gas phase reaction between hydrogen (H) at a moderately-elevated temperature (450& xc2xb0C) and high pressure ():This reaction is both exothermic and results in decreased entropy, meaning that the reaction is favoured at lower temperatures Hydrogen can also be produced from water and electricity using electrolysis: at one time, most of Europe's ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at Vemork.The amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with sodium or potassium hydroxide, the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard sulfuric acid and the excess of acid then determined volumetrically; or the ammonia may be absorbed in hydrochloric acid and the ammonium chloride so formed precipitated as ammonium hexachloroplatinate, (NH.Sulfur sticks are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems.It is measured in units of mg/L (milligram per litre).The ancient Greek historian Herodotus mentioned that there were outcrops of salt in an area of Libya that was inhabited by a people called the "Ammonians" (now:  the Siwa oasis in northwestern Egypt, where salt lakes still exist).The land of the Ammonians is mentioned elsewhere in Herodotus' History and in Pausanias' Description of Greece:The fermentation of urine by bacteria produces a solution of ammonia; hence fermented urine was used in Classical Antiquity to wash cloth and clothing, to remove hair from hides in preparation for tanning, to serve as a mordant in dying cloth, and to remove rust from iron.See:In the form of sal ammoniac (xd9x86xd8xb4xd8xa7xd8xafxd8xb1, nushadir), ammonia was important to the Muslim alchemists as early as the 8th century, first mentioned by the Persian-Arab chemist Jxc4x81bir ibn Hayyxc4x81n,See also:  Kopp, Hermann, Geschichte der Chemie [History of Chemistry] (Braunschweig, (Germany):  Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn, 1845), Part 3, [https://archive.org/stream/geschichtederche03unse#page/243/mode/2up p.It was first used on an industrial scale in Germany during World War I,Before the availability of natural gas, hydrogen as a precursor to ammonia production was produced via the electrolysis of water or using the chloralkali process.With the advent of the steel industry in the 20th century, ammonia became a byproduct of the production of coking coal.In the US as of 2019, approximately 88% of ammonia was used as fertilizers either as its salts, solutions or anhydrously.Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds.Ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater.Ammonia is also found throughout the Solar System on Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, among other places: on smaller, icy bodies such as Pluto, ammonia can act as a geologically important antifreeze, as a mixture of water and ammonia can have a melting point as low as  if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such bodies to retain internal oceans and active geology at a far lower temperature than would be possible with water alone.Since ammonia contains no carbon, its combustion cannot produce carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, or soot.Even though ammonia production currently creates 1.8% of global CO2 emissions, a 2020 Royal Society report claims that "green" ammonia can be produced by using low-carbon hydrogen (blue hydrogen and green hydrogen).In 1981, a Canadian company converted a 1981 Chevrolet Impala to operate using ammonia as fuel.Compared to hydrogen as a fuel, ammonia is much more energy efficient, and could be produced, stored, and delivered at a much lower cost than hydrogen which must be kept compressed as a cryogenic liquid.Rocket engines have also been fueled by ammonia.However, recent studies have shown that efficient and stable combustion of ammonia can be achieved using swirl combustors, thereby rekindling research interest in ammonia as a fuel for thermal power production.In organic chemistry, ammonia can act as a nucleophile in substitution reactions. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Finding, largely due to a lack of good Albertosaurus skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, Dale Russell declared the name Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of Albertosaurus, which had been named first, and G. libratus was renamed Albertosaurus libratus in 1970.The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality.There is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs, including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This was done, for example, by systems programmers working with IBM's Conversational Monitor System / Virtual Machine (VM/CMS) and with IBM's "real time transaction processing" add-ons, Customer Information Control System CICS, and ACP/TPF, the airline/financial system that began in the 1970s and still runs many large computer reservation systems (CRS) and credit card systems today.It is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages, for example, to generate a version of a program in COBOL using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of COBOL code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code.A-natural was built as the object language of a C compiler, rather than for hand-coding, but its logical syntax won some fans.There has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large-scale assembly language development.Assemblers with a strong macro engine allow structured programming via macros, such as the switch macro provided with the Masm32 package (this code is a complete program):include masm32includemasm32rt.inct; use the Masm32 library.codedemomain:  REPEAT 20tswitch rv(nrandom, 9)t; generate a number between 0 and 8tmov ecx, 7tcase 0ttprint "case 0"tcase ecxtttt; in contrast to most other programming languages,ttprint "case 7"tt; the Masm32 switch allows "variable cases"tcase 1 .. 3tt.if eax2tttprint "case 2"tt.elsetttprint "cases 1 to 3: other"tt.endiftcase 4, 6, 8ttprint "cases 4, 6 or 8"tdefaultttmov ebx, 19tt     ; print 20 starstt.Repeattttprint "*"tttdec ebxtt.Until Sign?tt ; loop until the sign flag is settendswtprint chr$(13, 10)  ENDM  exitend demomainAssembly languages were not available at the time when the stored-program computer was introduced.Assembly language examples for these follow.MOV AL, 1h        ; Load AL with immediate value 1MOV CL, 2h        ; Load CL with immediate value 2MOV DL, 3h        ; Load DL with immediate value 3The syntax of MOV can also be more complex as the following examples show.MOV EAX, [EBX]t  ; Move the 4 bytes in memory at the address contained in EBX into EAXMOV [ESI+EAX], CL ; Move the contents of CL into the byte at address ESI+EAXMOV DS, DX        ; Move the contents of DX into segment register DSIn each case, the MOV mnemonic is translated directly into one of the opcodes 88-8C, 8E, A0-A3, B0-BF, C6 or C7 by an assembler, and the programmer normally does not have to know or remember which.Transforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assembler, and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a disassembler.It is doubtful whether in practice many people who programmed the V20 and V30 actually wrote in NEC's assembly language rather than Intel's; since any two assembly languages for the same instruction set architecture are isomorphic (somewhat like English and Pig Latin), there is no requirement to use a manufacturer's own published assembly language with that manufacturer's products.There is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use.A two-pass assembler would determine both addresses in pass 1, so they would be known when generating code in pass 2.    B       ...    EQU *   ...   EQU *   ...     B   More sophisticated high-level assemblers provide language abstractions such as:See Language design below for more details.A program written in assembly language consists of a series of mnemonic processor instructions and meta-statements (known variously as directives, pseudo-instructions, and pseudo-ops), comments and data.Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but comments and statements that are assembler directives, and symbolic labels of program and memory locations are often also supported.The term "assembler" is generally attributed to Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill in their 1951 book The preparation of programs for an electronic digital computer,Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and sometimes to an operating system.Assembler macro instructions, like macros in PL/I and some other languages, can be lengthy "programs" by themselves, executed by interpretation by the assembler during assembly.Since macros can have 'short' names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code, they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter, requiring fewer lines of source code, as with higher level languages. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It is commonly understood in the Christian Tradition that Ambrose baptized Augustine.In a passage of Augustine's Confessions in which Augustine wonders why he could not share his burden with Ambrose, he comments: "Ambrose himself I esteemed a happy man, as the world counted happiness, because great personages held him in honor.Marked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.In his writings, Ambrose refers only to the performance of psalms, in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an antiphon.Saint Ambrose was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn "Te Deum", which he is said to have composed when he baptised Saint Augustine of Hippo, his celebrated convert.Ambrose was Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine's conversion, and is mentioned in Augustine's Confessions.This is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human sin and divine grace, and in the place which he assigns to faith in the individual Christian life.File:Sergio de Castro, Verrixc3xa8re de la Crxc3xa9ation du Monde, 1956-59.jpg| Stained-glass window by Sergio de Castro based on the Ambrosian hymns about the Creation of the universe, Church of the Benedictines at Couvrechef xe2x80x93 La Folie (Caen), 1956xe2x80x9359.File:Sergio de Castro, 7e jour de la Crxc3xa9ation, Le Repos Divin, 1956-59.jpg| Detail of the Seventh Day of Creation: divine rest with the Ambrosian hymns.Saint Ambrose in His Study, .The controversy of John Chrysostom with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop.In 392, after the death of Valentinian II and the fall of Eugenius, Ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius after Theodosius was eventually victorious.In his treatise on Abraham, Ambrose warns against intermarriage with pagans, Jews, or heretics. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the Epirus trade), and its consequent aversion to Corcyra (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the Battle of Sybota, which took place in 433 BC between the rebellious Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and Corinth).Ambraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the Amphilochians and Acarnanians. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions, crosslinking and cyclization.Heated above , amber decomposes, yielding an oil of amber, and leaves a black residue which is known as "amber colophony", or "amber pitch"; when dissolved in oil of turpentine or in linseed oil this forms "amber varnish" or "amber lac".Molecular polymerization, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into copal.Other uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as "cherry amber"), green amber, and even blue amber, which is rare and highly sought after.Yellow amber is a hard fossil resin from evergreen trees, and despite the name it can be translucent, yellow, orange, or brown colored.Pliny states explicitly that the Germans exported amber to Pannonia, from where the Veneti distributed it onwards.The ancient Italic peoples of southern Italy used to work amber; the National Archaeological Museum of Siritide (Museo Archeologico Nazionale della Siritide) at Policoro in the province of Matera (Basilicata) displays important surviving examples.Amber used in antiquity as at Mycenae and in the prehistory of the Mediterranean comes from deposits of Sicily.Pliny also cites the opinion of Nicias ( 470xe2x80x93413 BC), according to whom amber Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is "produced by the Sun", Pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin, citing the native Latin name of succinum (sxc5xabcinum, from sucus "juice").This kind of amber is known as "bony amber".Although all Dominican amber is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is blue amber. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Their second was Louisa May, who fictionalized her experience with the family in her novel Little Women in 1868.A native New Englander, Amos Bronson Alcott was born in Wolcott, Connecticut (then recently renamed from "Farmingbury") on November 29, 1799.At age six, young Bronson began his formal education in a one-room schoolhouse in the center of town but learned how to read at home with the help of his mother.At age 17, Alcott passed the exam for a teaching certificate but had trouble finding work as a teacher.By the summer of 1823, Alcott returned to Connecticut in debt to his father, who bailed him out after his last two unsuccessful sales trips.On January 14, 1863, the Alcotts received a telegram that Louisa was sick; Bronson immediately went to bring her home, briefly meeting Abraham Lincoln while there.Henry David Thoreau died on May 6, 1862, At Emerson's request, Alcott helped arrange Thoreau's funeral, which was held at First Parish Sanctuary in Concord,In 1868, Alcott met with publisher Thomas Niles, an admirer of Hospital Sketches.Remaining steadfast to his pedagogy, a forerunner of progressive and democratic schooling, he alienated parents in a later "parlor school" by admitting an African American child to the class, whom he then refused to expel in the face of protests.Beginning in 1836, Alcott's membership in the Transcendental Club put him in such company as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Orestes Brownson and Theodore Parker.In late April 1840, Alcott moved to the town of Concord In the first issue, for example, he wrote:On July 26, 1840, Abby May gave birth again. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Alabaster was used for vessels dedicated for use in the cult of the deity Bast in the culture of the ancient Egyptians, and thousands of gypsum alabaster artifacts dating to the late 4th millennium BC also have been found in Tell Brak (present day Nagar), in Syria.In Mesopotamia, gypsum alabaster was the material of choice for figures of deities and devotees in temples, as in a figure believed to represent the deity Abu dating to the first half of the 3rd millennium BC and currently kept in New York.Much of the world's alabaster extraction is performed in the centre of the Ebro Valley in Aragon, Spain, which has the world's largest known exploitable deposits.There are two separate sites in Aragon, both are located in Tertiary basins.The most important site is the Fuentes-Azaila area, in the Tertiary Ebro Basin.The other is the Calatayud-Teruel Basin, which divides the Iberian Range in two main sectors (NW and SE).The abundance of Aragonese alabaster was crucial for its use in architecture, sculpture and decoration.There is no record of likely use by pre-Roman cultures, so perhaps the first ones to use alabaster in Aragon were the Romans, who produced vessels from alabaster following the Greek and Egyptian models.It seems that since the reconstruction of the Roman Wall in Zaragoza in the 3rd century AD with alabaster, the use of this material became common in building for centuries.Muslim Saraqusta (today, Zaragoza) was also called "Medina Albaida", the White City, due to the appearance of its alabaster walls and palaces, which stood out among gardens, groves and orchards by the Ebro and Huerva Rivers.The oldest remains in the Aljaferxc3xada Palace, together with other interesting elements like capitals, reliefs and inscriptions, were made using alabaster, but it was during the artistic and economic blossoming of the Renaissance that Aragonese alabaster reached its golden age.In the 16th century sculptors in Aragon chose alabaster for their best works.They have been used throughout history primarily for carving decorative artifacts.The calcite type is also denominated "onyx-marble", "Egyptian alabaster", and "Oriental alabaster" and is geologically described as either a compact banded travertine "Onyx-marble" is a traditional, but geologically inaccurate, name because both onyx and marble have geological definitions that are distinct from even the broadest definition of "alabaster".In general, ancient alabaster is calcite in the wider Middle East, including Egypt and Mesopotamia, while it is gypsum in medieval Europe.Its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that the marble often shows on cross-section, from which its name is derived: onyx-marble or alabaster-onyx, or sometimes simply (and wrongly) as onyx.Egyptian alabaster has been worked extensively near Suez and Assiut.This stone variety is the "alabaster" of the ancient Egyptians and Bible and is often termed Oriental alabaster, since the early examples came from the Far East.It was used primarily in medieval Europe, and is also used in modern times."Mosul marble" is a kind of gypsum alabaster found in the north of modern Iraq, which was used for the Assyrian palace reliefs of the 9th to 7th centuries BC; these are the largest type of alabaster sculptures to have been regularly made. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The secondary eclipse when the brighter primary star occults the fainter secondary is very shallow and can only be detected photoelectrically.Algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable, known as Algol variables.An Ancient Egyptian Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days composed some 3,200 years ago is claimed to be the oldest historical documentation of the discovery of Algol.The association of Algol with a demon-like creature (Gorgon in the Greek tradition, ghoul in the Arabic tradition) suggests that its variability was known long before the 17th century,The variability of Algol was noted in 1667 by Italian astronomer Geminiano Montanari,In 1881, the Harvard astronomer Edward Charles Pickering presented evidence that Algol was actually an eclipsing binary.Some difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that a third star may be present in the system; four decades later this conjecture was found to be correct.{| class="wikitable" |+ Observing Algol's Eclipses in 2019 and 2020  From the point of view of the Earth, Algol& Aa1 and Algol& Aa2 form an eclipsing binary because their orbital plane contains the  line of sight to the Earth. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune "Hephzibah" by English composer John Husband."Amazing Grace", with the words written by Newton and joined with "New Britain", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847.Another verse was first recorded in Harriet Beecher Stowe's immensely influential 1852 anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin.The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in Olney Hymns are faith in salvation, wonder at God's grace, his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith.William Phipps in the Anglican Theological Review and author James Basker have interpreted the first stanza of "Amazing Grace" as evidence of Newton's realisation that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations."Amazing Grace" became newly popular during a revival of folk music in the US during the 1960s, and it has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century.According to the Dictionary of American Hymnology, "Amazing Grace" is John Newton's spiritual autobiography in verse.In 1725, Newton was born in Wapping, a district in London near the Thames. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Such sins, argued Alcuin, were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women, for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the Flood, and merit to be "withered by flames unto eternal barrenness".In several churches of the Anglican Communion, Alcuin is celebrated on 20 May, the first available day after the day of his death (as Dunstan is celebrated on 19 May).Alcuin College, one of the colleges of the University of York, England, is named after him.In January 2020, Alcuin was the subject of the BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time.For a complete census of Alcuin's works, see Marie-Hxc3xa9lxc3xa8ne Jullien and Franxc3xa7oise Perelman, eds., Clavis scriptorum latinorum medii aevi: Auctores Galliae 735xe2x80x93987.Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and in the midst of these pursuits, he died.Alcuin is the most prominent figure of the Carolingian Renaissance, in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the Anglo-Saxons are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of Theodulf the Visigoth is preponderant.Alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work xe2x80x93 a grammar and works on rhetoric and dialectics. </my-abstract>

<title>Absolute zero</title>
<wiki-abstract> Absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value, taken as zero kelvins. The fundamental particles of nature have minimum vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy-induced particle motion. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as xe2x88x92273.15xc2xb0 on the Celsius scale (International System of Units), and a system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero.John Dalton in his Chemical Philosophy gave ten calculations of this value, and finally adopted xe2x88x923,000& xc2xb0C as the natural zero of temperature.After James Prescott Joule had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, Lord Kelvin approached the question from an entirely different point of view, and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature that was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based on Carnot's theory of the Motive Power of Heat and data published by Henri Victor Regnault.With a better theoretical understanding of absolute zero, scientists were eager to reach this temperature in the lab. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas also increases its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the gas temperature and an additional rise in pressure above what would result from a simplistic calculation of 10 times the original pressure.We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law, PV& =& nRT (n is amount of gas in moles and R the gas constant for that gas).There is always some heat loss, as no perfect insulators exist.For a simple substance, during an adiabatic process in which the volume increases, the internal energy of the working substance must decreaseThe mathematical equation for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process can be represented by the polytropic process equationwhere  is pressure,  is volume, and for this case  xcexb3}}, where being the specific heat for constant pressure,  being the specific heat for constant volume,  is the adiabatic index, and  is the number of degrees of freedom (3 for monatomic gas, 5 for diatomic gas and collinear molecules e.g.</math>Equation (4) is often expressed as  nC dT}} because  xcexb1R}}.Now substitute equations (2) and (4) into equation (1) to obtainfactorize :and divide both sides by :After integrating the left and right sides from  to  and from  to  and changing the sides respectively,Exponentiate both sides, substitute }} with , the heat capacity ratioand eliminate the negative sign to obtainTherefore,andSubstituting the ideal gas law into the above, we obtainwhich simplifies toThe change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal toAt the same time, the work done by the pressurexe2x80x93volume changes as a result from this process, is equal toSince we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be trueBy the previous derivation,Rearranging (4) givesSubstituting this into (2) givesIntegrating we obtain the expression for work,Substituting  }} in second term,Rearranging,Using the ideal gas law and assuming a constant molar quantity (as often happens in practical cases),By the continuous formula,orSubstituting into the previous expression for ,Substituting this expression and (1) in (3) givesSimplifying,thumbAn adiabat is a curve of constant entropy in a diagram.xcexb3P}}, where  is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and at constant volume ( }} ) and  is the pressure of the gas .For a closed system, one may write the first law of thermodynamics as :  Q xe2x80x93 W}}, where  denotes the change of the system's internal energy,  the quantity of energy added to it as heat, and  the work done by the system on its surroundings.Naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible (entropy is produced).The transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds.The model assumptions are: the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is one litre (1& L = 1000& cm<sup>3</sup> = 0.001& m<sup>3</sup>); the gas within is the air consisting of molecular nitrogen and oxygen only (thus a diatomic gas with 5 degrees of freedom, and so  }}); the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1& L volume of uncompressed gas is reduced to 0.1& L by the piston); and the uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27& xc2xb0C, or 300& K, and a pressure of 1& bar = 100& kPa, i.e. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.The importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.Animism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal spirit entities.In the early 20th century, William McDougall defended a form of Animism in his book Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism (1911).Physicist Nick Herbert has argued for "quantum animism" in which mind permeates the world at every level:Werner Krieglstein wrote regarding his quantum Animism:In Error and Loss: A Licence to Enchantment, Ashley Curtis (2018) has argued that the Cartesian idea of an experiencing subject facing off with an inert physical world is incoherent at its very foundation, and that this incoherence is predicted rather than belied by Darwinism.According to Tylor, animism often includes "an idea of pervading life and will in nature;" but the terms now have distinct meanings.For Tylor, animism represented the earliest form of religion, being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion which has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality.Thus, for Tylor, animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake, a basic error from which all religion grew.For Abram, reading can usefully be understood as an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of animistic participation in which we once engaged.<blockquote>To tell the story in this mannerxe2x80x94to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way aroundxe2x80x94is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It had electricity installed only in 1962.Dame Jean was at one time a lady-in-waiting to Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, patron of the Dandie Dinmont Club, a breed of dog named after one of Sir Walter Scott's characters; and a horse trainer, one of whose horses, Sir Wattie, ridden by Ian Stark, won two silver medals at the 1988 Summer Olympics.On Dame Jean's death the Abbotsford Trust was established to safeguard the estate.In 2005, Scottish Borders Council considered an application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank of the River Tweed from Abbotsford, to which Historic Scotland and the National Trust for Scotland objected.Sir Walter Scott rescued the "jougs" from Threave Castle in Dumfries and Galloway and attached them to the castellated gateway he built at Abbotsford.Tweedbank railway station is located near to Abbotsford.Abbotsford gave its name to the Abbotsford Club, founded by William Barclay Turnbull in 1833 or 1834 in Scott's honour, and a successor to the Bannatyne and Maitland Clubs. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> During his sojourning in Canaan, Abraham was accustomed to extend hospitality to travelers and strangers and taught how to praise God also knowledge of God to those who had received his kindness.Besides Isaac and Jacob, he is the one whose name would appear united with God, as God in Judaism was called Elohei Abraham, Elohei Yitzchaq ve Elohei Ya`aqob ("God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob") and never the God of any one else.In Islam, Abraham holds an exalted position among the major prophets and he is referred to as "Ibrahim Khalilullah", meaning "Abraham the Beloved of Allah".Besides Ishaq and Yaqub, Ibrahim is among the most honorable and the most excellent men in sight of God.The Druze regard Abraham as the third spokesman (natiq) after Adam and Noah, who helped transmit the foundational teachings of monotheism (tawhid) intended for the larger audience.Paintings on the life of Abraham tend to focus on only a few incidents: the sacrifice of Isaac; meeting Melchizedek; entertaining the three angels; Hagar in the desert; and a few others.In Islam, the prophet Muhammad claimed Abraham, whose submission to God constituted Islam, was a "believer before the fact" and undercut Jewish claims to an exclusive relationship with God and the Covenant.In Jewish tradition, Abraham is called Avraham Avinu (xd7x90xd7x91xd7xa8xd7x94xd7x9d xd7x90xd7x91xd7x99xd7xa0xd7x95), "our father Abraham," signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews and the father of Judaism, the first Jew.Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham; and, while promises are made to Ishmael about founding a great nation, Isaac, Abraham's son by his half-sister Sarah, inherits God's promises to Abraham. </my-abstract>

Osoronnophris whom none has ever seen... awesome and invisible god with an empty spirit"; the name also includes Iaxc5x8d and Adxc5x8dnai. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It is also notable for the Abydos graffiti, ancient Phoenician and Aramaic graffiti found on the walls of the Temple of Seti I.The Great Temple and most of the ancient town are buried under the modern buildings to the north of the Seti temple.Most of Upper Egypt became unified under rulers from Abydos during the Naqada III period (3200xe2x80x933000 BCE), at the expense of rival cities such as Hierakonpolis.The pharaohs of the First Dynasty were buried in Abydos, including Narmer, who is regarded as the founder of the First Dynasty, and his successor, Aha.He also made a processional way leading past the side of the temple to the cemetery beyond, featuring a great gateway of granite.Seti I, during the Nineteenth Dynasty, founded a temple to the south of the town in honor of the ancestral pharaohs of the early dynasties; this was finished by Ramesses II, who also built a lesser temple of his own. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> One of the first commercial computer graphics houses, Digital Effects, produced an APL graphics product named Visions, which was used to create television commercials and animation for the 1982 film Tron.Today, APL remains in use in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications, for exampleinvestment management,asset management,health care,and DNA profiling,The first implementation of APL using recognizable APL symbols was APL360 which ran on the IBM System/360, and was completed in November 1966In 1975, the IBM 5100 microcomputer offered APL360 The two companies were I. P. Sharp Associates (IPSA), an APL360 services company formed in 1964 by Ian Sharp, Roger Moore and others, and STSC, a time-sharing and consulting service company formed in 1969 by Lawrence Breed and others.The SIGAPL special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery continues to support the APL community.On microcomputers, which became available from the mid 1970s onwards, BASIC became the dominant programming language.The Commodore SuperPET, introduced in 1981, included an APL interpreter developed by the University of Waterloo.In 1976, Bill Gates claimed in his Open Letter to Hobbyists that Microsoft Corporation was implementing APL for the Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800 but had "very little incentive to make [it] available to hobbyists" because of software piracy.As other vendors were busy developing APL interpreters for new hardware, notably Unix-based microcomputers, APL2 was almost always the standard chosen for new APL interpreter developments.The preface states its premise:This notation was used inside IBM for short research reports on computer systems, such as the Burroughs B5000 and its stack mechanism when stack machines versus register machines were being evaluated by IBM for upcoming computers.Iverson also used his notation in a draft of the chapter A Programming Language, written for a book he was writing with Fred Brooks, Automatic Data Processing, which would be published in 1963.In 1979, Iverson received the Turing Award for his work on APL.As early as 1962, the first attempt to use the notation to describe a complete computer system happened after Falkoff discussed with William C. Carter his work to standardize the instruction set for the machines that later became the IBM System/360 family.In 1963, Herbert Hellerman, working at the IBM Systems Research Institute, implemented a part of the notation on an IBM 1620 computer, and it was used by students in a special high school course on calculating transcendental functions by series summation.This was necessary because the APL character set was much larger than the 88 characters allowed on the typing element, even when letters were restricted to upper-case (capitals).The first APL interactive login and creation of an APL workspace was in 1966 by Larry Breed using an IBM 1050 terminal at the IBM Mohansic Labs near Thomas J. Watson Research Center, the home of APL, in Yorktown Heights, New York.IBM was chiefly responsible for introducing APL to the marketplace.Falkoff and Iverson had the special APL Selectric typing elements, 987 and 988, designed in late 1964, although no APL computer system was available to use them.Many APL symbols, even with the APL characters on the Selectric typing element, still had to be typed in by over-striking two extant element characters. </my-abstract>

<title>AWK</title>
<wiki-abstract> | year = </wiki-abstract>

<headings> History ,  Structure of AWK programs  ,  1</code> or <code>/^foo/</code>, the condition can be <code>BEGIN</code> or <code>END</code> causing the action to be executed before or after all records have been read, or pattern1, pattern2 which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches pattern1 up to and including the record that matches pattern2 before again trying to match against pattern1 on future lines.
In addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators, AWK expressions include the tilde operator, <code>~</code>, which matches a regular expression against a string. As handy syntactic sugar, /regexp/ without using the tilde operator matches against the current record; this syntax derives from sed, which in turn inherited it from the ed editor,  where <code>/</code> is used for searching. This syntax of using slashes as delimiters for regular expressions was subsequently adopted by Perl and ECMAScript, and is now common. The tilde operator was also adopted by Perl.
 , 
AWK commands are the statements that are substituted for action in the examples above. AWK commands can include function calls, variable assignments, calculations, or any combination thereof. AWK contains built-in support for many functions; many more are provided by the various flavors of AWK. Also, some flavors support the inclusion of dynamically linked libraries, which can also provide more functions.
 , 
The print command is used to output text. The output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator (ORS) whose default value is a newline. The simplest form of this command is:
; <code>print</code>
; <code>print $1</code>
; <code>print $1, $3</code>
Although these fields ($X) may bear resemblance to variables (the $ symbol indicates variables in Perl), they actually refer to the fields of the current record.  A special case, $0, refers to the entire record.  In fact, the commands "<code>print</code>" and "<code>print $0</code>" are identical in functionality.
The print command can also display the results of calculations and/or function calls:
/regex_pattern/ {
    # Actions to perform in the event the record (line) matches the above regex_pattern
    print 3+2
    print foobar(3)
    print foobar(variable)
    print sin(3-2)
}
Output may be sent to a file:
/regex_pattern/ {
    # Actions to perform in the event the record (line) matches the above regex_pattern
    print "expression" > "file name"
}
or through a pipe:
/regex_pattern/ {
    # Actions to perform in the event the record (line) matches the above regex_pattern
    print "expression" | "command"
}
 , 
Awk's built-in variables include the field variables: $1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 represents the entire record). They hold the text or values in the individual text-fields in a record.
Other variables include:
 , 
Variable names can use any of the characters [A-Za-z0-9_], with the exception of language keywords. The operators + - * / represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For string concatenation, simply place two variables (or string constants) next to each other. It is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved, but two variable names placed adjacent to each other require a space in between. Double quotes delimit string constants. Statements need not end with semicolons. Finally, comments can be added to programs by using # as the first character on a line.
 , 
In a format similar to C, function definitions consist of the keyword <code>function</code>, the function name, argument names and the function body.  Here is an example of a function.
function add_three (number) {
    return number + 3
}
This statement can be invoked as follows:
(pattern)
{
   print add_three(36)     # Outputs 39
}
Functions can have variables that are in the local scope. The names of these are added to the end of the argument list, though values for these should be omitted when calling the function. It is convention to add some whitespace in the argument list before the local variables, to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin.
 , 
 , 
Here is the customary "Hello, world" program written in AWK:
BEGIN { print "Hello, world!" }
Note that an explicit <code>exit</code> statement is not needed here; since the only pattern is <code>BEGIN</code>, no command-line arguments are processed.
 , 
Print all lines longer than 80 characters. Note that the default action is to print the current line.
length($0) > 80
 ,  Sum last word  ,  Match a range of input lines  ,  1, NR % 4  ,  1 is true for the 1st, 5th, 9th, etc., lines of input.

<my-abstract> awk -v pattern="$pattern" ...).Finally, this is written in pure awk, without help from a shell or without the need to know too much about the implementation of the awk script (as the variable assignment on command line one does), but is a bit lengthy:BEGIN {    pattern = ARGV[1]    for (i = 1; i < ARGC; i++) # remove first argument        ARGV[i] = ARGV[i + 1]    ARGC--    if (ARGC == 1) { # the pattern was the only thing, so force read from standard input (used by book)        ARGC = 2        ARGV[1] = "-"    }}$0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME ":" $0 }The <code>BEGIN</code> is necessary not only to extract the first argument, but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the <code>BEGIN</code> block ends.The shell script makes an environment variable <code>pattern</code> containing the first argument, then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file.The next way uses command-line variable assignment, in which an argument to awk can be seen as an assignment to a variable:#!/bin/shpattern="$1"shiftawk '$0 ~ pattern { print FILENAME ":" $0 }' "pattern=$pattern" "$@"Or You can use the -v var=value command line option (e.g.This is the same pattern-action structure as sed.In addition to a simple AWK expression, such as <code>foo  Commands  The print command  Built-in variables  Variables and syntax  User-defined functions  Examples  Hello World  Print lines longer than 80 characters  Count words ===Count words in the input and print the number of lines, words, and characters (like wc):{    words += NF    chars += length + 1 # add one to account for the newline character at the end of each record (line)}END { print NR, words, chars }As there is no pattern for the first line of the program, every line of input matches by default, so the increment actions are executed for every line.Therefore, you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename <code>-</code>.On Unix-like operating systems self-contained AWK scripts can be constructed using the shebang syntax.For example, a script that prints the content of a given file may be built by creating a file named <code>print.awk</code> with the following content:#!/usr/bin/awk -f{ print $0 }It can be invoked with: <code>./print.awk <filename></code>The <code>-f</code> tells AWK that the argument that follows is the file to read the AWK program from, which is the same flag that is used in sed.For example, /^--cut here--$/, 0prints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression ^--cut here--$, that is, a line containing only the phrase "--cut here--", to the end.Word frequency using associative arrays:BEGIN {    FS="[^a-zA-Z]+"}{    for (i=1; i<=NF; i++)          words[tolower($i)]++}END {    for (i in words)         print i, words[i]}The BEGIN block sets the field separator to any sequence of non-alphabetic characters. </my-abstract>

Eisele as Pilot.Saturn IB launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-200 series number, "AS" indicating "Apollo Saturn" and the "2" indicating the second member of the Saturn rocket family.Saturn V launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-500 series number, "AS" indicating "Apollo Saturn" and the "5" indicating Saturn V.NASA's director of flight crew operations during the Apollo program was Donald K. "Deke" Slayton, one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts who was medically grounded in September 1962 due to a heart murmur.It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.Kennedy's goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The intervening 7th century was a period of genuine syncretism during which Christian symbolism and doctrine gradually grew in influence.Some scholars have speculated that members of the Alemannic elite such as king Gibuld due to Visigothic influence may have been converted to Arianism even in the later 5th century.In the mid-6th century, the Byzantine historian Agathias records, in the context of the wars of the Goths and Franks against Byzantium, that the Alemanni fighting among the troops of Frankish king Theudebald were like the Franks in all respects except religion, sinceA genetic study published in Science Advances in September 2018 examined the remains of eight individuals buried at a 7th century Alemannic graveyard in Niederstotzingen, Germany.The Alemanni thus were probably not primarily the Hermunduri, although some elements of them may have been present.Before the mention of Alemanni in the time of Caracalla, one would search in vain for Alemanni in the moderately detailed geography of southern Germany in Claudius Ptolemy, written in Greek in the mid-second century;  at that time, the people who later used that name likely were known by other designations.Nevertheless, some conclusions can be drawn from Ptolemy.As winter was upon them, they reoccupied a"fortification which was founded on the soil of the Alemanni that Trajan wished to be called with his own name".In this context, the use of Alemanni is possibly an anachronism, but it reveals that Ammianus believed they were the same people, which is consistent with the location of the Alemanni of Caracalla's campaigns.Germania by Tacitus (AD 90) in [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01040.htm Chapter 42] states that the Hermunduri were a tribe certainly located in the region that later became Thuringia. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In 2007 a literary critic for New Yorker magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000.In a 2010 book, the environmentalist Tim Flannery claimed that Wallace was 'the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival,' and suggested that Wallace's understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking.The Natural History Museum, London, co-ordinated commemorative events for the Wallace centenary worldwide in the 'Wallace100' project in 2013.A more comprehensive list of Wallace's publications that are available online, as well as a full bibliography of all of Wallace's writings, has been compiled by the historian Charles H. Smith at The Alfred Russel Wallace Page.File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.101725 - Corvus enca celebensis Stresemann, 1936 - Corvidae - bird skin specimen.jpeg|Corvus enca celebensis, Sula Islands, registered in 1861 at a forerunner of Naturalis Biodiversity CenterFile:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.133615 2 - Toxorhamphus novaeguineae novaeguineae (Lesson, 1827) - Meliphagidae - bird skin specimen.jpeg|Toxorhamphus novaeguineae novaeguineae, Misool, Raja Ampat Islands, 1865File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.130620 1 - Pitohui ferrugineus leucorhynchus (Gray, 1862) - Pachycephalidae - bird skin specimen.jpeg|Pitohui ferrugineus leucorhynchus, Waigeo, West-Papua, no yearFile:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.134843 2 - Nectarinia jugularis clementiae (Lesson, 1827) - Nectariniidae - bird skin specimen.jpeg|Nectarinia jugularis clementiae, Seram Island, 1865File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.144722 2 - Mino anais anais (Lesson, 1839) - Sturnidae - bird skin specimen.jpeg|Mino anais anais, South West Papua, 1863'These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that sexual selection could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena.While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas.As the historian of science Michael Shermer has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy, which were that evolution was not teleological (purpose driven) and that it was not anthropocentric (human-centred).This prompted Darwin to publish On the Origin of Species.Like Darwin, Wallace did extensive fieldwork; first in the Amazon River basin, and then in the Malay Archipelago, where he identified the faunal divide now termed the Wallace Line, which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts: a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect Australasia.He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the "father of biogeography".Wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas (such as evolution).Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Neath Mechanics' Institute, founded in 1843.During this period, he read avidly, exchanging letters with Bates about Robert Chambers' anonymously published evolutionary treatise Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Charles Darwin's The Voyage of the Beagle, and Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology.Inspired by the chronicles of earlier and contemporary travelling naturalists, including Alexander von Humboldt, Ida Laura Pfeiffer, Charles Darwin and especially William Henry Edwards, Wallace decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist.To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works.In 1876, Wallace needed a xc2xa3500 advance from the publisher of The Geographical Distribution of Animals to avoid having to sell some of his personal property.John Stuart Mill was impressed by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in The Malay Archipelago.a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century.In many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory.Both Darwin and Wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection, and some of the factors responsible for it: competition between species and geographical isolation.Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.Another factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results.In 1890, Wallace gave evidence before a Royal Commission investigating the controversy. </my-abstract>

<lines> 24 </lines>
<my-abstract> Posthumously, he became known as Alcibiades.Albert was born in Ansbach and, losing his father Casimir in 1527, he came under the guardianship of his uncle George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, a strong adherent of Protestantism.In 1541, he received Bayreuth as his share of the family lands, but as the chief town of his principality was Kulmbach, he is sometimes referred to as the Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.His restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career; and having collected a small band of soldiers, he assisted Emperor Charles V in his war with France in 1543.The Peace of Crxc3xa9py in September 1544 deprived him of this employment, but he won a considerable reputation, and when Charles was preparing to attack the Schmalkaldic League, he took pains to win Albert's assistance.Sharing in the attack on the Electorate of Saxony, Albert was taken prisoner at Rochlitz in March 1547 by Elector John Frederick of Saxony, but was released as a result of the Emperor's victory at the Battle of Mxc3xbchlberg in the succeeding April.He then followed the fortunes of his friend Elector Maurice of Saxony, deserted Charles, and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the Emperor by an alliance with King Henry II of France.He took part in the subsequent campaign, but when the Peace of Passau was signed in August 1552 he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in Franconia, which led to the Second Margrave War.Having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of Nuremberg, he quarrelled with his supporter, the French King, and offered his services to the Emperor.Charles, anxious to secure such a famous fighter, gladly assented to Albert's demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of Wxc3xbcrzburg and Bamberg; and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the Emperor on the retreat from the Siege of Metz in January 1553.When Charles left Germany a few weeks later, Albert renewed his depredations in Franconia. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Nine years later however, the USPSTF issued a grade B recommendation for the use of low-dose aspirin (75 to 100mg/day) "for the primary prevention of CVD [cardiovascular disease] and CRC in adults 50 to 59 years of age who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years".A meta-analysis through 2019 found that aspirin reduces the risk of cancer of the colorectum, esophagus, and stomach.Along with rheumatic fever, Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in childrenLow-dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia.Another study of 400 healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant, but some had "pseudoresistance, reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption".Aspirin is sometimes used in veterinary medicine as an anticoagulant or to relieve pain associated with musculoskeletal inflammation or osteoarthritis.The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), , recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colon cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years.In those with no previous history of heart disease, aspirin decreases the risk of a non-fatal myocardial infarction but increases the risk of bleeding and does not change the overall risk of death.After percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), such as the placement of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely.The reason of this widespread use is the evidence of its proven effectiveness in major systemic venous thrombotic disorders, and it has been assumed that may be similarly beneficial in various types of retinal vein occlusion.However, a large-scale investigation based on data of nearly 700 patients showed "that aspirin or other antiplatelet aggregating agents or anticoagulants adversely influence the visual outcome in patients with CRVO and hemi-CRVO, without any evidence of protective or beneficial effect".Large doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, cause temporary tinnitus (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action on arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade.Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Phanariotes constituted a kind of Dhimmi nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state.In the year 1712, the Mughal Emperor Jahandar Shah, the grandson of Aurangzeb sent gifts to the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III and referred to himself as the Ottoman Sultan's devoted admirer.The Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar a grandson of Aurangzeb, is also known to have sent a letter to the Ottomans but this time it was received by the Grand Vizier Nevxc5x9fehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha providing a graphic description of the efforts of the Mughal commander Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha against the Rajput and Maratha rebellion.Sultan Ahmed III had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on 20 September 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen Janissaries, led by the Albanian Patrona Halil, was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne.Ahmed voluntarily led his nephew Mahmud I (1730xe2x80x9354) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire.b'      DESCRIPTION: Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1703 to 1730.{ }Ahmed III (, Axe1xb8xa5med-i <u>s</u>xc4x81li<u>s</u>) <span dir="ltr">(30 December 16731 July 1736)</span> was Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and a son of Sultan Mehmed IV (r. 1648xe2x80x9387).He was also interested in calligraphy, which he had studied with the leading court calligraphers, primarily with Hafxc4xb1zOsman Efendi (died 1698), who influenced his art immensely, and, therefore, practiced it because of the influence of his elder brother, the future Sultan Mustafa II, who also became a notable calligrapher.During his princehood in Edirne, Ahmed made friendswith a bright officer-scribe, Ibrahim, from the city of Nevxc5x9fehir, who was to become one of the outstanding Grand Viziers of his future reign. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> According to Alexei Nakamura,  only 205 Ainu live in Russia (up from just 12 people who self-identified as Ainu in 2008) and they along with the Kurile Kamchadals (Itelmen of Kuril islands) are fighting for official recognition.The Ainu have emphasized that they were the natives of the Kuril islands and that the Japanese and Russians were both invaders. both the Kuril Ainu and Kuril Kamchadal ethnic groups lack the fishing and hunting rights which the Russian government grants to the indigenous tribal communities of the far north.In March 2017, Alexei Nakamura revealed that plans for an Ainu village to be created in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and plans for an Ainu dictionary are underway.Recent research suggests that the historical Ainu culture originated in a merger of the Okhotsk culture with the Satsumon, one of the ancient archaeological cultures that are considered to have derived from the Jxc5x8dmon-period cultures of the Japanese archipelago.Anthropologist Joseph Powell (1999) of the University of New Mexico wrote "... we follow Brace and Hunt (1990) and Turner (1990) in viewing the Ainu as a southeast Asian population derived from early Jomon peoples of Japan, who have their closest biological affinity with South Asians rather than western Eurasian peoples".Sjxc3xb6berg quotes Baba's (1890) account of the Japanese government's reasoning:In 1899, the Japanese government passed an act labelling the Ainu as "former aborigines", with the idea they would assimilatexe2x80x94this resulted in the Japanese government taking the land where the Ainu people lived and placing it from then on under Japanese control..]]The Ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own landxe2x80x94over a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese.Their most widely known ethnonym is derived from the word ainu, which means "human" (particularly as opposed to kamui, divine beings).It now is run exclusively by Ainu and operates mostly independently of the government.Other key institutions include The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC), set up by the Japanese government after enactment of the Ainu Culture Law in 1997, the Hokkaidxc5x8d University Center for Ainu and Indigenous StudiesSince late 2011, the Ainu have cultural exchange and cultural cooperation with the Sxc3xa1mi people of northern Europe.b'      DESCRIPTION: Ethnic group in Japan and Russia.{ }The Ainu or the Aynu (Ainu: xe3x82xa2xe3x82xa3xe3x83x8c, Aynu, xd0x90xd0xb8xd0xbdxd1x83; Japanese: , Ainu; Russian: , xc3x81xc4xadny), also known as the Ezo (xe8x9dxa6xe5xa4xb7) in historical Japanese texts, are an East Asian ethnic group indigenous to Japan, the original inhabitants of Hokkaidxc5x8dOfficial estimates place the total Ainu population of Japan at 25,000.2004), haplogroup D (9/51 = 17.6%, particularly D4(xD1)), haplogroup M7a (8/51 = 15.7%), and haplogroup G1 (8/51 = 15.7%).A 2004 reevaluation of cranial traits suggests that the Ainu resemble the Okhotsk more than they do the Jxc5x8dmon.A 2012 genetic study has revealed that the closest genetic relatives of the Ainu are the Ryukyuan people, followed by the Yamato people and Nivkh.A genetic analysis in 2016 showed that although the Ainu have some genetic relations to the Japanese people and Eastern Siberians (especially Itelmens and Chukchis), they are not closely related to any modern ethnic group. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Acupuncture has been called 'theatrical placebo',Publication bias is cited as a concern in the reviews of randomized controlled trials of acupuncture.Scientist and journalist Steven Salzberg identifies acupuncture and Chinese medicine generally as a focus for "fake medical journals" such as the Journal of Acupuncture and Meridian Studies and Acupuncture in Medicine.The conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent with each other.A 2014 systematic review suggests that the nocebo effect of acupuncture is clinically relevant and that the rate of adverse events may be a gauge of the nocebo effect.A 2013 systematic review found that acupuncture may be effective for nonspecific lower back pain, but the authors noted there were limitations in the studies examined, such as heterogeneity in study characteristics and low methodological quality in many studies.Two separate 2016 Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture could be useful in the prophylaxis of tension-type headaches and episodic migraines.A 2013 Cochrane review found low to moderate evidence that acupuncture improves pain and stiffness in treating people with fibromyalgia compared with no treatment and standard care.A 2012 review found that the effectiveness of acupuncture to treat rheumatoid arthritis is "sparse and inconclusive.Whether combining PC6 acupoint stimulation with antiemetics is effective was inconclusive.A 2014 overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to suggest that acupuncture is effective for surgical or post-operative pain.A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews (internationally and without language restrictions) found that serious complications following acupuncture continue to be reported.A 2013 review found (without restrictions regarding publication date, study type or language) 295 cases of infections; mycobacterium was the pathogen in at least 96%.A 2013 systematic review of the English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk.Acupuncture seems to be safe in people getting anticoagulants, assuming needles are used at the correct location and depth.b'      DESCRIPTION: alternative medicine practice characterized as quackery by modern medical science..{ }{ }Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine because the theories and practices of TCM are not based on scientific knowledge, and it has been characterized as quackery.The conclusions of trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture are inconsistent, which suggests that it is not effective.Acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle technique and single-use needles.Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi, meridians, and acupuncture points,</ref> "The traditional principles of acupuncture are deeply flawed, as there is no evidence at all to demonstrate the existence of Ch'i or meridians"}}Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine.Acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles into the skin.In traditional acupuncture, the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used.It is a generally held belief within the acupuncture community that acupuncture points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals, but no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians.Some studies suggest acupuncture causes a series of events within the central nervous system, A 2014 review in Nature Reviews Cancer found that since the key mouse studies that suggested acupuncture relieves pain via the local release of adenosine, which then triggered nearby A1 receptors "caused more tissue damage and inflammation relative to the size of the animal in mice than in humans, such studies unnecessarily muddled a finding that local inflammation can result in the local release of adenosine with analgesic effect. </my-abstract>

Le Guin's Lavinia, a re-telling of the last six books of the Aeneid told from the point of view of Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus of Latium.Aeneas appears in David Gemmell's Troy series as a main heroic character who goes by the name Helikaon.In Rick Riordan's book series The Heroes of Olympus, Aeneas is regarded as the first Roman demigod, son of Venus rather than Aphrodite.Will Adams' novel City of the Lost assumes that much of the information provided by Virgil is mistaken, and that the true Aeneas and Dido did not meet and love in Carthage but in a Phoenician colony at Cyprus, on the site of the modern Famagusta.The ballad ultimately alters Aeneas's fate from traveling on years after Dido's death to joining her as a spirit soon after her suicide.In modern literature, Aeneas is the speaker in two poems by Allen Tate, "Aeneas at Washington" and "Aeneas at New York". </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home, but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline, notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes, which led to Sparta's humiliation at the Battle of Leuctra and thus the end of Spartan hegemony.And when asked whether Agesilaus wanted a memorial erected in his honor:Agesilaus lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field, and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty, he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth.When someone was praising an orator for his ability to magnify small points, Agesilaus said, "In my opinion it's not a good cobbler who fits large shoes on small feet.b'      DESCRIPTION: 4th-century BC Spartan king.{ }Agesilaus II (;  Agesilaos; c. 444/443 xe2x80x93 c. 360 BC), was a king (basileus) of the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta and a member of the Eurypontid dynasty ruling from 398 to about 360 BC, during most of which time he was, in Plutarch's words, "as good as though commander and king of all Greece", and was for the whole of it greatly identified with his country's deeds and fortunes. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Her portraiture can be contrasted with that of Livia who had a more austere Augustan hairstyle.There are three different periods during the first-century AD when portraits were created for Agrippina: at the time of her marriage to Germanicus (which made her the mother of a potential emperor); when her son Caligula came into power in AD 37, and collected her ashes from the island of Pandateria for relocation to the Mausoleum of Augustus; and at the time of Claudius' marriage to Antonia Minor, who wanted to connect himself to the lineage of Augustus by evoking Agrippina's image.It was a corollary to the adoption, probably in the next year, that Agrippina was married to Germanicus.By her husband Germanicus, she had nine children: Nero Julius Caesar, Drusus Julius Caesar, Tiberius Julius Caesar, a child of unknown name (normally referenced as Ignotus), Gaius the Elder, the Emperor Caligula (Gaius the Younger), the Empress Agrippina the Younger , Julia Drusilla, and Julia Livilla.Alston suggests that Sejanus may have been acting in Tiberius' favor to remove Germanicus' family from power, noting that Agrippina and Nero's brother Drusus were left in exile even after Sejanus' death.The deaths of Agrippina's older sons elevated her youngest son Caligula to the position of successor and he became princeps when Tiberius died in AD 37. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It was centered in the city of Akkad During the 3rd millennium BC, there developed a cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism.The Akkadian Empire reached its political peak between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests by its founder Sargon of Akkad.After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, the people of Mesopotamia eventually coalesced into two major Akkadian-speaking nations: Assyria in the north, and, a few centuries later, Babylonia in the south.The Bible refers to Akkad as The Great City in Genesis 10:10xe2x80x9312, which states:Nimrod's historical identity is unknown or debated, but Nimrod has been identified as Sargon of Akkad by some,Excavation at the modern site of Tell Brak has suggested that the Akkadians rebuilt a city ("Brak" or "Nagar") on this site, for use as an administrative center.Taxes were paid in produce and labour on public walls, including city walls, temples, irrigation canals and waterways, producing huge agricultural surpluses.In later Assyrian and Babylonian texts, the name Akkad, together with Sumer, appears as part of the royal title, as in the Sumerian LUGAL KI-EN-GI KI-URI or Akkadian xc5xa0ar mxc4x81t xc5xa0umeri u Akkadi, This title was assumed by the king who seized control of Nippur, the intellectual and religious center of southern Mesopotamia.During the Akkadian period, the Akkadian language became the lingua franca of the Middle East, and was officially used for administration, although the Sumerian language remained as a spoken and literary language.Indus-Mesopotamia relations also seem to have expanded: Sargon of Akkad (circa 2300 or 2250 BC), was the first Mesopotamian ruler to make an explicit reference to the region of Meluhha, which is generally understood as being the Baluchistan or the Indus area.File:Adda Seal Akkadian Empire 2300 BC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Inscription "Adda, the scribe", hunting god with bow and an arrow, Ishtar with weapons rising from her shoulders, emerging sun-god Shamash, Zu bird of destiny, water god Ea with bull between legs, two-faced attendant god Usimu with right hand raised.During the 3rd millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism.Enheduanna, The Exaltation of Inanna. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Halsall's observations are similar, as he contends that the Roman general's "decision to permit Alaric's withdrawal into Pannonia makes sense if we see Alaric's force entering Stilicho's service, and Stilicho's victory being less total than Claudian would have us believe".These barbarian peoples included: Vandals in Spain and Africa, Visigoths in Spain and Aquitaine, Burgundians along the upper Rhine and southern Gaul, and Franks onthe lower Rhine and in northern and central Gaul.The chief authorities on the career of Alaric are: the historian Orosius and the poet Claudian, both contemporary, neither disinterested; Zosimus, a historian who lived probably about half a century after Alaric's death; and Jordanes, a Goth who wrote the history of his nation in 551, basing his work on Cassiodorus's Gothic History.' </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It was only when faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an exarch in Ravenna with the capacity to defend the country without the Emperor's assistance.The consolidation of Byzantine and Lombard dominions had long-lasting consequences for Italy, as the region was from that moment on fragmented among multiple rulers until Italian unification in 1871.Alboin, together with other tribal leaders is mentioned in the 10th century Old English poem called Widsith (lines 70-75) :The historical period also formed the basis of the 1961 Italian  adventure film Sword of the Conqueror (Italian: Rosmunda e Alboino, German title Alboin, Kxc3xb6nig der Langobarden), with Jack Palance as Alboin.There have been several artistic depictions of events from Alboin's life including Peter Paul Rubens' Alboin and Rosamunde (1615); Charles Landseer's Assassination of Alboin, King of the Lombards (1856); and Fortunino Matania's illustration Rosamund captive before King Alboin of the Lombards (1942).'The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's policies eastward.The impact of the Lombard migration on the Late Roman aristocracy was disruptive, especially in combination with the Gothic War; the latter conflict had finished in the north only in 562, when the last Gothic stronghold, Verona, was taken.In the view of Pierre Richxc3xa9, the disappearance of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church.The first attested instance of strong resistance to Alboin's migration took place at the town of Ticinum (Pavia), which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years.At the Battle of Asfeld (552), he killed Turismod, son of the Gepid king Thurisind, in a victory that resulted in the Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers.Alboin came to the throne after the death of his father, sometime between 560 and 565.An account of the war by the Byzantine Theophylact Simocatta sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict, claiming it originated with Alboin's vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of Cunimund's daughter Rosamund, that Alboin proceeded then to marry. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In the first part of this work, called "Brasxc3xa3o" (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Afonso being one of the wings of the griffin headed by Henry the Navigator, the other wing being King John II.A variety of mango that he used to bring on his journeys to India has been named in his honour.Numerous homages have been paid to Afonso; he is featured in the Padrxc3xa3o dos Descobrimentos monument; there is a square carrying his name in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, which also features a bronze statue; two Portuguese Navy ships have been named in his honour: the sloop NRP Afonso de Albuquerque (1884) and the warship NRP Afonso de Albuquerque, the latter belonging to a sloop class named Albuquerque.The fabled Spice Islands were on the imagination of Europe since ancient times.Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.After 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Graxc3xa7a church in Lisbon, which was ruined and rebuilt after the 1755 Great Lisbon earthquake.Albuquerque Monument on Afonso de Albuquerque Square in Lisbon (1902)King Manuel I of Portugal was belatedly convinced of Afonso's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in Afonso by heaping honours upon his son, Brxc3xa1s de Albuquerque (1500xe2x80x931580), whom he renamed "Afonso" in memory of the father.Afonso de Albuquerque was a prolific writer, having sent numerous letters to the king during his governorship, covering topics from minor issues to major strategies.He was educated in the Palace of the King D. Afonso V, in whose palaestra he strove emulously to become the rival of that African Mars".Afonso served for 10 years in North Africa, where he gained military experience in fierce campaigns against the Muslim states there and against the Ottoman Empire.In 1471, under the command of Afonso V of Portugal, he was present at the conquest of Tangier and Arzila in Morocco, In 1489 he returned to military campaigns in North Africa, as commander of defense in the Graciosa fortress, an island in the river Luco near the city of Larache, and in 1490 was part of the guard of King John II, returning to Arzila in 1495, where his younger brother Martim died fighting by his side.Afonso made his mark under the stern John II, and won military campaigns in Africa and the Mediterranean sea, yet Asia is where he would make his greatest impact.When King Manuel I of Portugal was enthroned, he showed some reticence towards Afonso, a close friend of his dreaded predecessor and seventeen years his senior. </my-abstract>

<title>Alcaeus of Mytilene</title>
<wiki-abstract> Alcaeus of Mytilene (; , Alkaios ho Mutilēnaios;  –  BC) Greek poet|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-10-17}} was a lyric poet from the Greek island of Lesbos who is credited with inventing the Alcaic stanza. He was included in the canonical list of nine lyric poets by the scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> His verses have not come down to us through a manuscript tradition xe2x80x94 generations of scribes copying an author's collected works, such as delivered intact into the modern age four entire books of Pindar's odes xe2x80x94 but haphazardly, in quotes from ancient scholars and commentators whose own works have chanced to survive, and in the tattered remnants of papyri uncovered from an ancient rubbish pile at Oxyrhynchus and other locations in Egypt: sources that modern scholars have studied and correlated exhaustively, adding little by little to the world's store of poetic fragments.Ancient scholars quoted Alcaeus in support of various arguments.Alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own 'down-to-earth' style and Sappho's more 'celestial' qualities when he describes her almost as a goddess (as cited above), and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with a balance between the divine and the profane, each emphasising different elements in that balance.Dionysius of Halicarnassus exhorts us to "Observe in Alcaeus the sublimity, brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power, his splendid figures, and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect; and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairs,"The works of Alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres.The following verses demonstrate some key characteristics of the Alcaic style (square brackets indicate uncertainties in the ancient text):Let's drink! </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> During his reign, Russia fought no major wars; he was therefore styled "The Peacemaker" ().Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich was born on 10 March 1845 at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, the second son and third child of Emperor Alexander II and his first wife Maria Alexandrovna (nxc3xa9e Princess Marie of Hesse).In disposition, Alexander bore little resemblance to his soft-hearted, liberal father, and still less to his refined, philosophic, sentimental, chivalrous, yet cunning great-uncle Emperor Alexander I, who could have been given the title of "the first gentleman of Europe".A sebaceous cyst on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries, and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent.An account from the memoirs of the artist Alexander Benois gives one impression of Alexander III:Though he was destined to be a strongly counter-reforming emperor, Alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life, as he had an elder brother, Nicholas, who seemed of robust constitution.These ideas conflicted with those of his father, who had German sympathies despite being a patriot; Alexander II often used the German language in his private relations, occasionally ridiculed the Slavophiles and based his foreign policy on the Prussian alliance.Some differences between father and son had first appeared during the Franco-Prussian War, when Alexander II supported the cabinet of Berlin while the Tsesarevich made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the French. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He confirmed that soldiers could name anyone as heirs in their will, whereas civilians had strict restrictions over who could become heirs or receive a legacy.On the whole, Alexander's reign was prosperous until the rise, in the east, of the SassanidsAlthough the Sassanids were checked for the time,Alexander's reign was also characterized by a significant breakdown of military discipline.Dio was among those who gave a highly critical account of military discipline during the time, saying that the soldiers would rather just surrender to the enemy.Herodian, on the other hand, was convinced that "the emperor's miserliness (partly the result of his mother's greed) and slowness to bestow donatives" were instrumental in the fall of military discipline under Alexander.After the Persian war, Alexander returned to Antioch with the famous Origen, one of the greatest Fathers of the Christian Church.It seems likely that Bassianus was his family name, since several of his relatives were also called as such, and Alexianus his actual given name, which was later converted to Alexander.The historian Cassius Dio thought Alexianus was the son of Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus, but Icks disputes this, saying the latter could not have married the emperor's mother before 212 and that Alexianus must've been fathered by his mother's first husband, who is of unknown name but of certain existence.Severus Alexander became emperor when he was around 14 years old, making him the youngest emperor in Rome's history, until the ascension of Gordian III. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Alexios' policy of integration of the nobility bore the fruit of continuity: every Byzantine emperor who reigned after Alexios& I Komnenos was related to him by either descent or marriage.By his marriage with Irene Doukaina, Alexios& I had the following children:# Anna Komnene (2 December 1083 xe2x80x93 1148/55), in her infancy she was betrothed to Constantine Doukas, and with him treated as co-ruler by her father until after the birth of John II.Alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the Seljuq camps, but these victories were unable to stop the Turks altogether.The "Prince's Crusade", the second and much more formidable host of crusaders, gradually made its way to Constantinople, led in sections by Godfrey of Bouillon, Bohemond of Taranto, Raymond IV of Toulouse, and other important members of the western nobility.Around this time, in 1106, the twentieth year of his reign, Hesychius of Miletus records that the sky suddenly darkened and a "violent southern wind" blew great statue of Constantine at the Strategion from its column, killing a number of men and women nearby.In 1116, though already terminally ill, Alexios conducted a series of defensive operations in Bythinia and Mysia to defend his Anatolian territories against the inroads of Malik Shah, the Seljuq Sultan of Iconium. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Alexios IV Angelos, the son of the deposed Isaac II, had recently escaped from Constantinople and now appealed for support to the crusaders, promising to end the East-West Schism, to pay for their transport, and to provide military support if they would help him depose his uncle and ascend to his father's throne.The crusaders, whose objective had been Egypt, were persuaded to set their course for Constantinople, arriving there in June 1203, proclaiming Alexios IV as Emperor, and inviting the populace of the capital to depose his uncle. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to Andrew Jackson Jr. except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and family members.Jackson had three adopted sons: Theodore, an Indian about whom little is known, Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and Lyncoya, a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Battle of Tallushatchee.During the American Civil War, the Confederate government issued two Confederate postage stamps bearing Jackson's portrait, one a 2-cent red stamp and the other a 2-cent green stamp, both issued in 1863.Memorials to Jackson include a set of four identical equestrian statues by the sculptor Clark Mills: in Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.; in Jackson Square, New Orleans; in Nashville on the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol; and in Jacksonville, Florida.Jackson and his wife Rachel were the main subjects of a 1951 historical novel by Irving Stone, The President's Lady, which told the story of their lives up until Rachel's death.Jackson, his mother, and his brothers lived with Jackson's aunt and uncle in the Waxhaws region, and Jackson received schooling from two nearby priests.Jackson's exact birthplace is unclear because of a lack of knowledge of his mother's actions immediately following her husband's funeral.Jackson's political opponents castigated the veto as "the very slang of the leveller and demagogue," claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.At Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process.By a Congressional resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the Thanks of Congress and awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.Alexis de Tocqueville ("underwhelmed" by Jackson according to a 2001 commentator) later wrote in Democracy in America that Jackson "was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."A series of pamphlets known as the Coffin Handbills were published to attack Jackson, one of which revealed his order to execute soldiers at New Orleans.Rachel Jackson was also a frequent target of attacks, and was widely accused of bigamy, a reference to the controversial situation of her marriage with Jackson.Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.In 1833, Jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated and that the moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates also wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.On February 22, 1866, Washington's Birthday, Johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the White House and called for an address in honor of the first president.The burial ground was dedicated as the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in 1906, and with his home and tailor's shop, is part of the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site.According to Castel, "historians [of Johnson's presidency] have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event [Reconstruction]".Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.Now Vice President-elect, Johnson was anxious to complete the work of reestablishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4.Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.Grant, under protest, followed Johnson's order transferring Sheridan and another of the district commanders, Daniel Sickles, who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress's plan.Johnson won the election by 63,413 votes to 61,163; some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support Whig Nathaniel Taylor for his old seat in Congress.Tennessee's governor had little power: Johnson could propose legislation but not veto it, and most appointments were made by the Whig-controlled legislature.With most of Tennessee in Confederate hands, Johnson spent congressional recesses in Kentucky and Ohio, trying in vain to convince any Union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into East Tennessee.Johnson's first tenure in the Senate came to a conclusion in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee.The former president was defeated, finishing third, but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favor of an old Johnson Unionist ally, Horace Maynard.In 1873, Johnson contracted cholera during an epidemic but recovered; that year he lost about $73,000, when the First National Bank of Washington went under, though he was eventually repaid much of the sum. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Therefore, Solzhenitsyn argued, Russian nationalism and the Orthodox Church should not be regarded as a threat by the West but rather as allies.In "Rebuilding Russia", an essay first published in 1990 in Komsomolskaya Pravda Solzhenitsyn urged the Soviet Union to grant independence to all the non-Slav republics, which he claimed were sapping the Russian nation and he called for the creation of a new Slavic state bringing together Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Kazakhstan that he considered to be Russified.Solzhenitsyn gave a speech to AFLxe2x80x93CIO in Washington, D.C., on 30 June 1975 in which he mentioned how the system created by the Bolsheviks in 1917 caused dozens of problems in the Soviet Union.Solzhenitsyn was a fierce nationalist, arguing that Soviet culture "suppressed" traditional Russian and Ukrainian culture, and called for the creation of a united Slavic state encompassing Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, and was a fierce opponent of Ukrainian independence.Guided by KGB chief Yury Andropov, and following a statement from West German Chancellor Willy Brandt that Solzhenitsyn could live and work freely in West Germany, it was decided to deport the writer directly to that country., West Germany, 1974]]On 12 February 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested and deported the next day from the Soviet Union to Frankfurt, West Germany and stripped of his Soviet citizenship.In West Germany, Solzhenitsyn lived in Heinrich Bxc3xb6ll's house in .After the difficult cycles of such ponderings over many years, whenever I mentioned the heartlessness of our highest-ranking bureaucrats, the cruelty of our executioners, I remember myself in my Captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were we any better?'"In February 1945, while serving in East Prussia, Solzhenitsyn was arrested by SMERSH for writing derogatory comments in private letters to a friend, Nikolai Vitkevich,He was accused of anti-Soviet propaganda under Article 58 paragraph 10 of the Soviet criminal code, and of "founding a hostile organization" under paragraph 11.The first part of Solzhenitsyn's sentence was served in several work camps; the "middle phase", as he later referred to it, was spent in a sharashka (a special scientific research facility run by Ministry of State Security), where he met Lev Kopelev, upon whom he based the character of Lev Rubin in his book The First Circle, published in a self-censored or "distorted" version in the West in 1968 (an English translation of the full version was eventually published by Harper Perennial in October 2009). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Harlaw Academy was taken down from the list after a short time but is still a popular school.There are a number of private schools in Aberdeen: Robert Gordon's College, Albyn School for Girls (co-educational as of 2005), St& Margaret's School for Girls, the Hamilton School (closed by the Child Care Inspectorate in early 2014), the Total French School (for French oil industry families), the International School of Aberdeen and a Waldorf/Steiner School.Primary schools in Aberdeen include Airyhall Primary School, Albyn School, Ashley Road Primary School, Balgownie Primary School, Broomhill Primary School, Cornhill Primary School (the city's largest), Culter Primary School, Cults Primary School, Danestone Primary School, Fernielea Primary school, Ferryhill Primary School, Gilcomstoun Primary School, Glashieburn Primary School, Greenbrae School, Hamilton School, Kaimhill Primary School, Kingsford Primary School, Kittybrewster Primary School, Middleton Park Primary School, Mile-End School, Muirfield Primary School, Robert Gordon's College, Skene Square Primary School, St. Joseph's Primary School and St& Margaret's School for Girls.The city has a wide range of cultural activities, amenities and museums.The Aberdeen Maritime Museum, located in Shiprow, tells the story of Aberdeen's links with the sea from the days of sail and clipper ships to the latest oil and gas exploration technology.The King's Museum acts as the main museum of the university in the meantime.Aberdeen is home to a number of events and festivals including the Aberdeen International Youth Festival (the world's largest arts festival for young performers), Aberdeen Jazz Festival, Aberdeen Alternative Festival, Rootin' Aboot (a folk and roots music event), Triptych, the University of Aberdeen's literature festival Word and DanceLive, Scotland's only Festival of contemporary dance, which is produced by the city's Citymoves dance organisation.The Aberdeen Student Show, performed annually without interruption since 1921, under the auspices of the Aberdeen Students' Charities Campaign, is the longest-running of its kind in the United Kingdom.In Castle Street, a continuation eastwards of Union Street, is the new Aberdeen Town House, a very prominent landmark in Aberdeen, built between 1868 and 1873 to a design by Peddie and Kinnear.Alexander Marshall Mackenzie's extension to Marischal College on Broad Street, opened by King Edward VII in 1906, created the second largest granite building in the world (after the Escorial, Madrid).In addition to the many fine landmark buildings, Aberdeen has many prominent public statues, three of the most notable being William Wallace at the junction between Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct, Robert Burns on Union Terrace above Union Terrace Gardens, and Robert the Bruce holding aloft the charter he issued to the city in 1319 on Broad Street, outside Marischal College.Aberdeen has long been famous for its 45 in the centre of Aberdeen bordered on three sides by Union Street, Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct.The current Lord Provost is Barney Crockett.Aberdeen is represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom by three constituencies: Aberdeen North and Aberdeen South which are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area, and Gordon, which includes a large area of the Aberdeenshire Council area.In the Scottish Parliament, the city is represented by three constituencies with different boundaries: Aberdeen Central and Aberdeen Donside are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area.The council began major road improvements at the end of the 18th century with the main thoroughfares of George Street, King Street and Union Street all completed at the beginning of the 19th century. | image1 = Aberdeen1.jpg | caption1 = The Castlegate and Union Street | image2 = Union Terrace Aberdeen Scotland.jpg | caption2 = Union Terrace, Aberdeen}}The expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in 1817 during the Post-Napoleonic depression, an economic downturn immediately after the Napoleonic Wars; but the city's prosperity later recovered.It is Scotland's third most populous city, one of Scotland's 32 local government council areas (as Aberdeen CityDuring the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries, Aberdeen's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite, which can sparkle like silver because of its high mica content.Aberdeen used to host the Aberdeen International Youth Festival, a major international event which attracted up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies but the council ended funding in 2017 and the festival was wound up in 2018. </my-abstract>

<title>Antipope</title>
<wiki-abstract> An antipope () is a person who, in opposition to the lawful pope, makes a significant attempt to occupy the position of Bishop of Rome and leader of the Catholic Church."One who opposes the legitimately elected bishop of Rome, endeavours to secure the papal throne, and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt" (Encyclopædia Britannica: Antipope). </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> At times between the 3rd and mid-15th centuries, antipopes were supported by important factions within the Church itself and by secular rulers.Sometimes it was difficult to distinguish which of two claimants should be called pope and which antipope, as in the case of Pope Leo VIII and Pope Benedict V.Persons who merely claim to be pope and have few followers, such as the modern sedevacantist antipopes, are not classified with the historical antipopes.Hippolytus of Rome (d.& 235) is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope, as he headed a separate group within the Church in Rome against Pope Callixtus I. Hippolytus was reconciled to Callixtus's second successor, Pope Pontian, and both he and Pontian are honoured as saints by the Catholic Church with a shared feast day on 13 August. </my-abstract>

<title>Aquaculture</title>
<wiki-abstract> Aquaculture (less commonly spelled aquiculture), also known as aquafarming, is the farming of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic plants, algae, and other organisms. Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions, and can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, fishmeal and oil from residues instead of whole fish have a different composition with more ash and less protein, which may limit its potential use for aquaculture.As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when seventy five percent of the worlds monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield.Another impact aquaculture production can have on wild fish is the risk of fish escaping from coastal pens, where they can interbreed with their wild counterparts, diluting wild genetic stocks.Salmon farms are typically sited in pristine coastal ecosystems which they then pollute.Particular methods include aquaponics and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, both of which integrate fish farming and aquatic plant farming.The Gunditjmara, the local Aboriginal Australian people in south-western Victoria, Australia, may have raised short-finned eels as early as about 4,580 BCE (6,530 years BP).Oral tradition in China tells of the culture of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio, as long ago as 2000xe2x80x932100 BCE (around 4,000 years BP), but the earliest significant evidence lies in the literature, in the earliest monograph on fish culture called The Classic of Fish Culture, by Fan Lai, written around 475 BCE (c.2475 BP).Ancient Egyptians might have farmed fish (especially Gilt-head bream) from Lake Bardawil about 1,500 BCE (3,520 years BP), and they traded them with Canaan.Gim cultivation is the oldest aquaculture in Korea.Domestication typically involves about a decade of scientific research. | header_align      = center | header_background =  | footer            =  | footer_align      =  | footer_background =  | background color  =  | image1    = Global aquaculture production.png | alt1      =  | caption1  = <center>Main species groups</center> | image2    = Global other aquaculture production.png | alt2      =  | caption2  = <center>Minor species groups</center>}}Microalgae, also referred to as phytoplankton, microphytes, or planktonic algae, constitute the majority of cultivated algae.With 5.8 percent annualgrowth rate during the period 2001xe2x80x932016, aquaculture continues to grow faster than other major food production sectors, but it no longer has the high annual growth rates experienced in the 1980s and 1990s.In 2012, the total world production of fisheries was 158 million tonnes, of which aquaculture contributed 66.6 million tonnes, about 42%.FAO (2014) [http://www.fao.org/3/d1eaa9a1-5a71-4e42-86c0-f2111f07de16/i3720e.pdf The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2014 (SOFIA)]</ref> The growth rate of worldwide aquaculture has been sustained and rapid, averaging about 8% per year for over 30 years, while the take from wild fisheries has been essentially flat for the last decade. </my-abstract>

                 return i
This program iterates through all possible programs (by iterating through all possible strings and only considering those which are valid programs), starting with the shortest. Each program is executed to find the result produced by that program, comparing it to the input s. If the result matches the length of the program is returned.
However this will not work because some of the programs p tested will not terminate, e.g. if they contain infinite loops. There is no way to avoid all of these programs by testing them in some way before executing them due to the non-computability of the halting problem.
What is more, no program at all can compute the function K, be it ever so sophisticated. This is proven in the following.

<my-abstract> Therefore, the optimal language is universal up to this additive constant.Theorem: If K chosen& xe2x80x93 such thatProof: By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant c such that for all strings sNow, suppose there is a program in the language L: function InterpretLanguage(string p)where p is a program in L. The interpreter is characterized by the following property:Thus, if P is a program in L which is a minimal description of s, then <code>InterpretLanguage</code>(P) returns the string s. The length of this description of s is the sum of# The length of the program <code>InterpretLanguage</code>, which we can take to be the constant c.# The length of P which by definition is K(s).This proves the desired upper bound.Algorithmic information theory is the area of computer science that studies Kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings (or other data structures).The concept and theory of Kolmogorov Complexity is based on a crucial theorem first discovered by Ray Solomonoff, who published it in 1960, describing it in "A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference"There are several other variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information.Some of these are proofs for formulas we do not care about here, since every possible proof in the language of S is produced for some n. Some of these are complexity formulas of the form K(s)& xe2x89xa5& n where s and n are constants in the language of S. There is a procedure function NthProofProvesComplexityFormula(int n)which determines whether the nth proof actually proves a complexity formula K(s)& xe2x89xa5& L. The strings s, and the integer L in turn, are computable by procedure: function StringNthProof(int n) function ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof(int n)Consider the following procedure: function GenerateProvablyComplexString(int n)     for i = 1 to infinity:         if NthProofProvesComplexityFormula(i) and ComplexityLowerBoundNthProof(i) xe2x89xa5 n             return StringNthProof(i)Given an n, this procedure tries every proof until it finds a string and a proof in the formal system S of the formula K(s)& xe2x89xa5& L for some L& xe2x89xa5& n; if no such proof exists, it loops forever.Finally, consider the program consisting of all these procedure definitions, and a main call: GenerateProvablyComplexString(n)where the constant n, under the reasonable assumption that it is encoded in binary digits.Now consider the function f:[2,xe2x88x9e)xe2x86x92[1,xe2x88x9e), defined by f(x) = x &minus; log(x).The most widely used one is based on self-delimiting programs, and is mainly due to Leonid Levin (1974).An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on Blum axioms (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by Andrey Kolmogorov.In the following discussion, let K(s) be the complexity of the string s.It is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself& xe2x80x94 the program <code>GenerateString2</code> above that outputs s is a fixed amount larger than s.Theorem: There is a constant c such thatAt first glance it might seem trivial to write a program which can compute K(s) for any s, such as the following: function KolmogorovComplexity(string s)     for i = 1 to infinity:         for each string p of length exactly i             if isValidProgram(p) and evaluate(p)  Formal proof of uncomputability of K====Theorem: There exist strings of arbitrarily large Kolmogorov complexity.A description will have two parts:In more technical terms, the first part of a description is a computer program, with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output.The invariance theorem follows: Given any description language L, the optimal description language is at least as efficient as L, with some constant overhead.Proof: Any description D in L can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing L as a computer program P (part 1), and then using the original description D as input to that program (part 2).To make this precise, fix a value of n. There are 2<sup>n</sup> bitstrings of length n. The uniform probability distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight 2<sup>xe2x88x92n</sup> to each string of length n.Theorem: With the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length n, the probability that a string is incompressible by c is at least 1 xe2x88x92 2<sup>xe2x88x92c+1</sup> + 2<sup>xe2x88x92n</sup>.To prove the theorem, note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding n xe2x88x92 c is given by the geometric series:There remain at leastbitstrings of length n that are incompressible by c.  To determine the probability, divide by 2<sup>n</sup>.By the above theorem (), most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly "compressed" way. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> During this period, the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment, and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath.This revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the episcopacy; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed "most necessary for all men to know"; the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to Adam, thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.Very little is known of the church under Alfred.The Proverbs of Alfred, a 13th-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.The Alfred jewel, discovered in Somerset in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its Old English inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN ('Alfred ordered me to be made').The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England, whereas Asser's The Life of King Alfred promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities.The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law.A number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour:The Royal Navy named one ship and two shore establishments HMS King Alfred, and one of the early ships of the U.S. Navy was named USS Alfred in his honour.Remarkably, Alfred xe2x80x93 undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars xe2x80x93 translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, St. Augustine's Soliloquies and the first fifty psalms of the Psalter.One might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the Vulgate Book of Exodus.Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.Asser wrote of Alfred in his Life of King Alfred, }}It is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was 12 years old or later, which is described as "shameful negligence" of his parents and tutors.By its terms, the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the River Thames to the River Lea, follow the Lea to its source (near Luton), from there extend in a straight line to Bedford, and from Bedford follow the River Ouse to Watling Street.In other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged kingdom of East Anglia (henceforward known as the Danelaw). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The precipitation is higher than in most of coastal Mediterranean Spain, and similar to most of coastal Mediterranean France, as opposed to the interior North African semi-arid or arid climate.Snow is very rare; in 2012, the city received  of snowfall, its first snowfall in eight years.The city (and province) of Algiers is composed of 13 administrative districts, sub-divided into 57 communes listed below with their populations at the 1998 and 2008 Censuses:There are many public buildings of interest, including the whole Kasbah quarter, Martyrs Square (Sahat ech-Chouhada xd8xb3xd8xa7xd8xadxd8xa9 xd8xa7xd9x84xd8xb4xd9x87xd8xafxd8xa7xd8xa1), the government offices (formerly the British consulate), the "Grand", "New", and Ketchaoua Mosques, the Roman Catholic cathedral of Notre Dame d'Afrique, the Bardo Museum, the old Bibliothxc3xa8que Nationale d'Algerxe2x80x94a Turkish palace built in 1799xe2x80x931800xe2x80x94and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the British Library.The main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest.However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.During World War II, Algiers was the first city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during Operation Torch.In 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and Pieds-Noirs) during fighting between the French Army and the Algerian Front de Libxc3xa9ration Nationale, Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. </my-abstract>

the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.Alhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as Exact Determination of the Meridian, a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the Milky Way; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.In mathematics, Alhazen built on the mathematical works of Euclid and Thabit ibn Qurra and worked on "the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry".Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses "were accountable to the laws of physics", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.He also wrote Maqala fi daw al-qamar (On the Light of the Moon).In his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the motion of a body.In his On the Configuration of the World Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth:, chap.22, p. 61</ref>}}The book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's Almagest, which was eventually translated into Hebrew and Latin in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as Georg von PeuerbachIn his Al-Shukxc5xabk xe2x80x9balxc4x81 Batlamyxc5xabs, variously translated as Doubts Concerning Ptolemy or Aporias against Ptolemy, published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized Ptolemy's Almagest, Planetary Hypotheses, and Optics, pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy.:He developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.Alhazen explored what is now known as the Euclidean parallel postulate, the fifth postulate in Euclid's Elements, using a proof by contradiction,In elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of squaring the circle using the area of lunes (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task.Alhazen's contributions to number theory include his work on perfect numbers.In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.Alhazen's most original contribution was that, after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.Alhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion..Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.Having pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work.Later mathematicians used Descartes' analytical methods to analyse the problem.Recently, Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) researchers solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors. The Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The doctrines of his followers, known as the Amalricians, were formally condemned by the fourth Lateran Council in 1215.Amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from Eriugena, whose principles he developed in a one-sided and strongly pantheistic form.Only three propositions can be attributed to him with certainty:#that God is all (omnia sunt deus) and thus all things are one because whatever is, is God (omnia unum, quia quidquid est, est Deus);#that every Christian is bound to believe that he is a member of the body of Christ, and that this belief is necessary for salvation;#that he who remains in love of God can commit no sin.Because of the first proposition, God himself is thought to be invisible and only recognizable in his creation.These three propositions were further developed by his followers, who maintained that God revealed Himself in a threefold revelation, the first in the Biblical patriarch Abraham, marking the epoch of the Father; the second in Jesus Christ, who began the epoch of the Son; and the third in Amalric and his disciples, who inaugurated the era of the Holy Ghost.Amalricians taught:Due to persecutions, this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Companyxe2x80x94the Amazon Steam Navigation Companyxe2x80x94as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Purxc3xbas and many other tributaries, such as the Maraxc3xb1xc3xb3n, to ports as distant as Nauta, Peru.By the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were India-rubber, cacao beans, Brazil nuts and a few other products of minor importance, such as pelts and exotic forest produce (resins, barks, woven hammocks, prized bird feathers, live animals) and extracted goods, such as lumber and gold.Since colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.Four centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than , excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro, the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.While debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest.A peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, concluded that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of  for the Nile and  for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.Therefore, as of 2018 the length of both Amazon and Nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate.The Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately .During glacial periods, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the world's second largest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.Paralleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the Hamza River, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America.Brazilian and Peruvian Studies in 2007 and 2008 added the waterway from the Amazon's southern outlet through tidal canals and the Parxc3xa1 estuary of the Tocantins and then concluded that the Amazon has a length of 6,992 km and was longer than the Nile, whose length was calculated as 6,853 km.A peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, states a length of 7,088 km for the Nile and 6,575 km for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.The headwaters of the Apurxc3xadmac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazon's most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the headwaters of the Mantaro River on the Cordillera Rumi Cruz in Peru. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Twelver Shi'a do not believe that Abu Bakr's being with Muhammad in the cave when the two fled Mecca was a meritorious act, and, indeed, find significant criticism of Abu Bakr in the Qur'anic verse of the cave.Most Twelver Shia criticize Abu Bakr because, after Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr refused to grant Muhammad's daughter, Fatimah, the lands of the village of Fadak which she claimed her father had given to her as a gift before his death.Some of them favoured the nomination and others disliked it, due to the tough nature of Umar.Abu Bakr thus dictated his last testament to Uthman ibn Affan as follows:Umar led the funeral prayer for him and he was buried beside the grave of Muhammad.The historian Al-Tabari, in regards to Abu Bakr's appearance, records the following interaction between Aisha and her paternal nephew, Abdullah ibn Abdul-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr:When she was in her howdah and saw a man from among the Arabs passing by, she said, "I have not seen a man more like Abu Bakr than this one."Early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter Aisha, who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, further strengthening relations between Abu Bakr and Muhammad.In 624, Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the Battle of Badr, but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad's tent.Aisha, Abu Saxe2x80x98id al-Khudri and Abdullah ibn Abbas in interpreting this verse said that Abu Bakr was the companion who stayed with Muhammad in the cave.After staying at the cave for three days and three nights, Abu Bakr and Muhammad proceed to Medina, staying for some time at Quba, a suburb of Medina.In Medina, Muhammad decided to construct a mosque.Abu Bakr died of illness after a reign of 2 years, 2 months and 14 days.Abu Bakr's full name was Abdullah ibn Uthman ibn Amir ibn Amr ibn Ka'b ibn Sa'd ibn Taym ibn Murrah ibn Ka'b ibn Lu'ayy Ghalib ibn Fihr.In Arabic, the name Abd Allah means "servant of Allah". </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Following the destructive assault of the Saxons, the survivors gather together under the leadership of Ambrosius, who is described as:Some basic information on Ambrosius can be deduced from the brief passage: Ambrosius was possibly of high birth and very likely a Christian (Gildas says that he won his battles "with God's help").According to Gildas, Ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the Saxon invaders.The relative passage has been translated as following:William swiftly shifts attention from Ambrosius to Arthur, and proceeds to narrate Arthur's supposed victory in the Battle of Badon.Ambrosius Aurelianus appears in later pseudo-chronicle tradition beginning with Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae with the slightly garbled name Aurelius Ambrosius, now presented as son of a King Constantine.In the church, "the purple" is a euphemism for blood and therefore "wearing the purple" may be a reference to martyrdomIt has been suggested by historian Alex Woolf that Ambrosius may have been related to the 5th-century Romano-British usurpers Marcus or Gratian xe2x80x93 Woolf expresses a preference based on nomenclature for Marcus.Mike Ashley instead focuses on the name "Ambrosius" And its possible connection to Saint Ambrosius, a fourth-century Bishop of Milan, who also served as consular governor in areas of Roman Italy. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Buddha then continued by teaching xc4x80nanda and other listeners about the Buddha nature.In the role of mediator between the Buddha and the lay communities, xc4x80nanda sometimes made suggestions to the Buddha for amendments in the monastic discipline.80}} Most importantly, the early texts attribute the inclusion of women in the early saxe1xb9x85gha (monastic order) to xc4x80nanda.3}} In the end, the Buddha allowed the Sxc4x81kiya women to be ordained, being the start of the bhikkhunxc4xab order.Von Hinxc3xbcber concludes this based on several patterns in the early texts, including the apparent distance between the Buddha and the bhikkhunxc4xab order, and the frequent discussions and differences of opinion that take place between xc4x80nanda and Mahxc4x81kassapa.7}} Some scholars have seen merits in von Hinxc3xbcber's argument with regard to the pro- and anti-factions, Buddhist studies scholar Bhikkhu Anxc4x81layo has responded to most of von Hinuber's arguments, writing: "Besides requiring too many assumptions, this hypothesis conflicts with nearly 'all the evidence preserved in the texts together'", arguing that it was monastic discipline that created a distance between the Buddha and the bhikkhunxc4xabs, and even so, there were many places in the early texts where the Buddha did address bhikkhunxc4xabs directly.)With regard to not requesting the Buddha to continue to live, many textual traditions have xc4x80nanda respond by saying he was distracted by Mxc4x81ra, though one early Chinese text has xc4x80nanda reply he did not request the Buddha to prolong his life, for fear that this would interfere with the next Buddha Maitreya's ministry.According to the Pxc4x81li tradition, the charges were laid after xc4x80nanda had become enlightened and done all the recitations; but the Mxc5xablasarvxc4x81stivxc4x81da tradition has it that the charges were laid before xc4x80nanda became enlightened and started the recitations. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b"      { }DESCRIPTION: Ancient Greek Pre-Socratic philosopher.Anaximenes of Miletus (; ; )As one of the three philosophers of the Milesian School, considered the first revolutionary thinkers of the Western world, this tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing is what he is principally remembered for today.Apollodorus of Damascus noted the dates Anaximander was alive in relation to well-known historical events, and estimated Anaximenes' lifespan as having occurred during the same time period in which Cyrus the Great defeated Croesus at the Battle of Thymbra in 546 BC.While his predecessors Thales and Anaximander proposed that the archai (singular: arche, meaning the underlying material of the world) were water and the ambiguous substance apeiron, respectively, Anaximenes asserted that aer (xe2x80x9cmistxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cvaporxe2x80x9d, xe2x80x9cairxe2x80x9d) was this primary substance of which all natural things are made.The choice of air may seem arbitrary, but Anaximenes based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the processes of rarefaction and condensation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> (Hume 1974:324)In part two, Hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world:He shows how a satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration (since "it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change") nor experience (since that would be a circular argument).(Hume 1974:330-332) Here he is describing what would become known as the problem of induction.For Hume, we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of habit or custom, which human nature forces us to take seriously. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Byzantine rule gradually vanished from Anatolia as tribute failed to appease Ottoman sultan Orhan, who took Nicomedia (renamed xc4xb0zmit) in 1337, leaving only Philadelpheia and a handful of ports under Byzantine control.Despite these troubles, Andronikos III took advantage of a secession crisis in Despotate of Epirus to seize Byzantine control from Nikephoros II Orsini in 1337.John Kantakouzenos, megas domestikos of Andronikos III and later emperor, wielded effective administrative authority during the reign, while the Emperor personally enjoyed hunting and waging war.Andronikos III also reformed the judiciary through his creation of a panel of four judges, designated "Universal Justices of the Romans".Andronikos III was first married in 1318 with Irene of Brunswick, daughter of Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Lxc3xbcneburg; she died in 1324.Andronikos III wanted Nicomedia and the other few Byzantine forts in Anatolia not to suffer the same fate and sought to pay off the Ottomans with tribute.Andronikos III reorganized and attempted to strengthen the weakened Byzantine navy, which comprised only 10 ships by 1332; in emergencies, he still could muster a hundred extra merchant ships.To overcome his failure to secure gains against the Serbians, Andronikos III attempted to annex Bulgarian Thrace, but the new tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria defeated Byzantine forces at Battle of Rusokastro on 18 July 1332. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Since the rule of thumb was for backup crews to fly as prime crew three missions later, this put Neil Armstrong's crew (Borman's backup) in position to make the first landing attempt on Apollo 11 instead of Pete Conrad's crew, who made the second landing on Apollo 12. Scott, also Air Force, was selected in the third astronaut group in 1963 and flew alongside Neil Armstrong in Gemini 8, on which the first spacecraft docking was performed.The performance of the CSM in remaining stable while the engine was being gimbaled would in 1972 help cause McDivitt, by then manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program, to approve the continuation of Apollo 16 when its CSM was experiencing an unstable gimbal after separation from its LM in lunar orbit.The flight plan for the third day in space was to have the commander and lunar module pilot enter the LM to check out its systems and use its descent engine to move the entire spacecraft.During the ten-day mission, they tested systems and procedures critical to landing on the Moon, including the LM engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems and docking maneuvers.After launching on March 3, 1969, the crew performed the first crewed flight of a lunar module, the first docking and extraction of the same, one two-person spacewalk (EVA), and the second docking of two crewed spacecraftxe2x80x94two months after the Soviets performed a spacewalk crew transfer between  and . </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Although such materials are not useful, these discoveries led to the developments of organic semiconductors, as recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 to Alan J. Heeger, Alan G MacDiarmid, and Hideki Shirakawa.In the early 20th century acetylene was widely used for illumination, including street lighting in some towns.In the 1920s, pure acetylene was experimentally used as an inhalation anesthetic.Acetylene is sometimes used for carburization (that is, hardening) of steel when the object is too large to fit into a furnace.Acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in radiocarbon dating.The carbonxe2x80x93carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180xc2xb0.Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, who identified it as a "new carburet of hydrogen".Berthelot's empirical formula for acetylene (C), as well as the alternative name "quadricarbure d'hydrogxc3xa8ne" (hydrogen quadricarbide), were incorrect because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).Berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds (methanol, ethanol, etc.) </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The numerals themselves were referred to in the west as ashkxc4x81l alxe2x80x90ghubxc4x81r (dust figures, in Ibn al-Yxc4x81samin) or qalam al-ghubxc3xa5r (dust letters).The western Arabic variants of the symbols came to be used in Maghreb and Al-Andalus, which are the direct ancestor of the modern "Arabic numerals" used throughout the world.The divergence in the terminology has led some scholars to propose that the Western Arabic numerals had a separate origin in the so-called "ghubxc4x81r numerals" but the available evidence indicates no separate origin.Woepecke has also proposed that the Western Arabic numerals were already in use in Spain before the arrival of the Moors, purportedly received via Alexandria, but this theory is not accepted by scholars.Some popular myths have argued that the original forms of these symbols indicated their numeric value through the number of angles they contained, but no evidence exists of any such origin.The first mentions of the numerals in the West are found in the Codex Vigilanus of 976.From the 980s, Gerbert of Aurillac (later, Pope Sylvester II) used his position to spread knowledge of the numerals in Europe. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> On 18 October 2010, France announced a successful tactical ABM test of the Aster 30 missileIndia has an active ABM development effort using indigenously developed and integrated radars, and indigenous missiles.As of 8 January 2020, the BMD programme has been completed and the Indian Air Force and the DRDO are awaiting government's final go ahead before the system is deployed to protect New Delhi.#Outermost BMD layer at endo- and exo-atmospheric altitudes (15-25 km, and 80-100 km) for 2000 km ranges #S-400 layer at ranges of 120, 200, 250, & 380 km#Barak-8 layer  at ranges of 70-100 km#Akash layer  at ranges of 25 km#Surface to air missiles and gun systems as the inner-most ring of defense (potentially NASAMS-II).The Arrow ABM system was designed and constructed in Israel with financial support by the United States by a multibillion-dollar development program called "Minhelet Homa" (Wall Administration) with the participation of companies like Israel Military Industries, Tadiran and Israel Aerospace Industries.During 1998 the Israeli military conducted a successful test of their Arrow missile.(Infographic)  xe2x80x94Source: U.S. Missile Defense AgencyThe United States Army released information as early as 2004 about their plans to develop a command system that was intended to replace Raytheonxe2x80x99s Patriot missile (SAM) engagement control station (ECS) Army doctrine can now be updated to allow the launch of a single Patriot against a single target.Kestrel eye is a cubesat swarm designed to produce a picture of a designated ground target, and to relay the picture to the ground Warfighter every 10 minutes.Procurement of MIM-104 Patriot and indigenous Tien-Kung anti-ballistic missile systems.The idea of destroying rockets before they can hit their target dates from the first use of modern missiles in warfare, the German V-1 and V-2 program of World War II.British fighters destroyed some V-1 "buzz bombs" in flight, although concentrated barrages of heavy anti-aircraft artillery had greater success.According to officials, the milestone test paves the way toward low-rate initial production of the Arrow 3.David's Sling (Hebrew: xd7xa7xd7x9cxd7xa2 xd7x93xd7x95xd7x93), also sometimes called Magic Wand (Hebrew: xd7xa9xd7xa8xd7x91xd7x99xd7x98 xd7xa7xd7xa1xd7x9exd7x99xd7x9d), is an Israel Defense Forces military system being jointly developed by the Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the American defense contractor Raytheon, designed to intercept tactical ballistic missiles, as well as medium- to long-range rockets and slower-flying cruise missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah, fired at ranges from 40& km to 300& km.The Alaska interceptors may be augmented later by the naval Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System or by ground-based missiles in other locations.During 1998, Defense secretary William Cohen proposed spending an additional $6.6 billion on intercontinental ballistic missile defense programs to build a system to protect against attacks from North Korea or accidental launches from Russia or China.In terms of organization, during 1993 SDI was reorganized as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Dozens of ATP equivalents are generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain.In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase, which is regulated by the availability of its substrate& xe2x80x93 the reduced form of cytochrome c. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates:frac12 ce{NADH} + ce{cyt} ce{c_{ox}} + ce{ADP} + ce{P_i} rightleftharpoonsfrac12 ce{NAD^+} + ce{cyt} ce{c_{red}} + ce{ATP}which directly implies this equation:frac{[mathrm{cyt~c_{red}}]}{[mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}}]} = left(frac{[mathrm{NADH}]}{[mathrm{NAD}]^{+}}right)^{frac{1}{2}}left(frac{[mathrm{ADP}] [mathrm{P_i}]}{[mathrm{ATP}]}right)K_mathrm{eq}Thus, a high ratio of [NADH] to [NAD<sup>+</sup>] or a high ratio of [ADP][P] to [ATP] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity.Ketone bodies can be used as fuels, yielding 22 ATP and 2 GTP molecules per acetoacetate molecule when oxidized in the mitochondria.A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH  Three ATP are produced per turn.Although oxygen consumption appears fundamental for the maintenance of the proton motive force, in the event of oxygen shortage (hypoxia), intracellular acidosis (mediated by enhanced glycolytic rates and ATP hydrolysis), contributes to mitochondrial membrane potential and directly drives ATP synthesis.Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix.ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases are needed to examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions.Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Guus Kroonen argues that the Germanic root *ahwxc5x8d- is probably of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) origin, as it may be cognate with Latin aqua (via the common form *hxe2x82x82ekxcaxb7-ehxe2x82x82-), and ultimately descend from the PIE root *hxe2x82x82ep- ('water'; compare with Sanskrit xc3xa1p- 'water' or Tocharian xc4x81p- 'water, river').Poetic kennings in both Hversu Noregr byggxc3xb0ist (How Norway Was Settled) and Skxc3xa1ldskaparmxc3xa1l (The Language of Poetry) treat xc3x86gir and the sea-giant Hlxc3xa9r, who lives on the Hlxc3xa9sey ('Hlxc3xa9r island', modern Lxc3xa6sxc3xb8), as the same figure.Both the prose introduction to Lokasenna (Loki's Flyting) and Skxc3xa1ldskaparmxc3xa1l state that xc3x86gir is also known as Gymir, the father of the jxc3xb6tunn (giantess) Gerxc3xb0r. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do not interfere with birth control pills,In cases where antibiotics have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills, such as for the broad-spectrum antibiotic rifampicin, these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes' causing increased breakdown of the pill's active ingredients.Interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy.Antibiotics such as metronidazole, tinidazole, cephamandole, latamoxef, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, and furazolidone, cause a disulfiram-like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, which may result in vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath.Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug.Resistance may take the form of biodegredation of pharmaceuticals, such as sulfamethazine-degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces.The survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance, For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome.These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist, in 1942.The term antibiotic was first used in 1942 by Selman Waksman and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is antagonistic to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution.Both the WHO and the Infectious Disease Society of America report that the weak antibiotic pipeline does not match bacteria's increasing ability to develop resistance. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> LA Weekly would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous immigrant in America, who "overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s".In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder became a huge success.Schwarzenegger said that during this time he encountered a friend who told him he was teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM), which prompted Schwarzenegger to reveal that he had been struggling with anxiety for the first time in his life: "Even today, I still benefit from [the year of TM] because I don't merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem.Schwarzenegger's first professional competition was in 1963 and he won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254& kg / 560& lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia.He continued his winning streak in the 1971xe2x80x9374 competitions.Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron.He had been rumored to be appearing in Terminator Salvation as the original T-800; he denied his involvement,On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the Arnold Classic, Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to The Terminator and remakes of Predator and The Running Man, and that he was "packaging" a comic book character.In August 2016, his filming of action-comedy Why We're Killing Gunther was temporarily interrupted by bank robbers near filming location in Surrey, British Columbia.On February 6, 2018, Amazon Studios announced they were working with Schwarzenegger to develop a new series entitled Outrider in which he will star and executive produce.He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson.Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a Red Cross ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television and radio public service announcements to donate blood.In an interview with Talk magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office.The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.Stallone and Schwarzenegger ended their longtime rivalry by both investing in the Planet Hollywood Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on "new US global business ventures" and his movie career.He also invested in a shopping mall in Columbus, Ohio.In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in James Cameron's science fiction thriller film The Terminator.During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes.In October 1994, Amway gave the biggest corporate contribution recorded to that date to a political party for a single election, $2.5& million to the Republican National Committee (RNC), and was the number one corporate political donor in the United States.In July 1996, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos was honored at a $3& million fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a week later, it was reported that Amway had tried to donate $1.3& million to pay for Republican "infomercials" and televising of the GOP convention on Pat Robertson's Family Channel, but backed off when Democrats criticized the donation as a ploy to avoid campaign-finance restrictions.A 1998 analysis of campaign contributions conducted by Businessweek found that Amway, along with the founding families and some top distributors, had donated at least $7& million to GOP causes in the preceding decade.According to a report by the Center for Public Integrity, in the 2004 election cycle, members of the Van Andel and DeVos families were the second, third and fifth largest donors to the Republican party.Dick DeVos, son of Amway founder Richard DeVos and past president of the company, served as Finance Chairman of the Republican National Committee,In May 2005, Dick DeVos ran against incumbent Governor Jennifer Granholm in Michigan's 2006 gubernatorial election.Moser states that DeVos was a supporter of the late D. James Kennedy, giving more than $5& million to Kennedy's Coral Ridge Ministries.Sociologist David G. Bromley calls Amway a "quasi-religious corporation" having sectarian characteristics.Amway co-founder Jay Van Andel (in 1980), and later his son Steve Van Andel (in 2001), were elected by the board of directors of the United States Chamber of Commerce to be the chairman of the private American lobbying organization.In a 1979 ruling,The FTC did, however, find Amway "guilty of price-fixing and making exaggerated income claims";Studies of independent consumer watchdog agencies have shown that between 990 and 999 of 1000 participants in MLMs that use Amway-type pay plans in fact lose money.In September 2006, following a public complaint, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana state police (CID) initiated raids and seizures against Amway distributors in the state, and submitted a petition against them, claiming the company violated the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act.On May 27, 2013, Crime Branch officials of Kerala Police arrested William S. Pinckney, Managing Director & CEO of Amway India Enterprises along with two other directors of the company from Kozhikode.The amendment was opposed by a coalition of consumer interest groups including Consumer Action, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union (the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine), Consumer Watchdog, the National Consumers League, and the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG),In 1982, Amway co-founders, Richard M. DeVos and Jay Van Andel, along with Amway's executive vice president for corporate services, William J. Mr. Discher Jr., were indicted in Canada on several criminal charges, including allegations that they underreported the value of goods brought into the country and had defrauded the Canadian government of more than $28 million from 1965 to 1980.The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), as part of its anti-piracy efforts, sued Amway and several distributors in 1996, alleging that copyrighted music was used on "highly profitable" training videotapes.In 1997, Amway Poland and Network TwentyOne separately sued the makers of a Polish film, Welcome to Life (), for defamation and copyright violations.DeVos and Van Andel bought the rights to manufacture and distribute Frisk, and later changed the name to LOC (Liquid Organic Cleaner).Amway bought a controlling interest in Nutrilite in 1972 and full ownership in 1994.Amway expanded to Australia in 1971, to parts of Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to Thailand in 1987, to China in 1995,In 2014, a Russian loyalty card program called "Alfa-Amway" was created when Amway joined with Alfa-Bank.Amway was ranked by Forbes as the 42nd-largest privately held company in the United States in 2018, and as the number one largest company on the Direct Selling News Global 100 list in 2018.The founders of the Amway corporation established a new holding company in 1999, named Alticor, and launched three new companies: a sister (and separate) Internet-focused company named Quixtar, Access Business Group, and Pyxis Innovations. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:However, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff "seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them" (The Wealth of Nations, IV.ii.39).Economic historians such as Jacob Viner regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called "natural liberty"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissez-faire.Economist Daniel Klein believes using the term "free-market economics" or "free-market economist" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading.The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to William Strahan, in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.In 1759, Smith published his first work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, sold by co-publishers Andrew Millar of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh.In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek "mutual sympathy of sentiments.Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson"xe2x80x94a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 at the University of Edinburgh,In 1750, Smith met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade.Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting "justice" and "certain publick institutions" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (The Wealth of Nations, IV.ix.51).Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He completed the work of Black, Priestley and Cavendish, and gave a correct explanation of their experiments.Overall, his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century.During his lifetime, Lavoisier was awarded a gold medal by the King of France for his work on urban street lighting (1766), and was appointed to the French Academy of Sciences (1768).Lavoisier's work was recognized as an International Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society, Acadxc3xa9mie des sciences de L'institut de France and the Socixc3xa9txc3xa9 Chimique de France in 1999.The interpretation of water as a compound explained the inflammable air generated from dissolving metals in acids (hydrogen produced when water decomposes) and the reduction of calces by inflammable air (a combination of gas from calx with oxygen to form water).Despite these experiments, Lavoisier's antiphlogistic approach remained unaccepted by many other chemists.Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of Henry Cavendish's inflammable air, which Lavoisier termed hydrogen (Greek for "water-former"), with "dephlogisticated air" (air in the process of combustion, now known to be oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> According to Salim Khan, they "strongly felt that Amitabh was the ideal casting for Zanjeer".Zanjeer was a crime film with violent action, It was the first of many collaborations between Salim-Javed and Amitabh Bachchan; Salim-Javed wrote many of their subsequent scripts with Bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as Deewaar (1975) and Sholay (1975).Eventually, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry.1978 is arguably considered his most successful year at the box office since all of his six releases the same year, namely Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Trishul, Don, Kasme Vaade, Ganga Ki Saugandh and Besharam were massive successes, the former three being the consecutive highest-grossing films of the year, remarkably releasing within a couple of months of each other, a rare feat in Indian cinema.In 1982, he played double roles in the musical Satte Pe Satta and action drama Desh Premee which succeeded at the box office along with mega hits like action comedy Namak Halaal, action drama Khud-Daar and the critically acclaimed drama Bemisal.Coolie injuryOn 26 July 1982, while filming Coolie, in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near-fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor Puneet Issar.Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation.Many have commented on the similarities between the plot of Silsila (which starred Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri and Rekha) and the private lives of Bachchan, Bhaduri and Rekha.Bachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen's National Award-winning film Bhuvan Shome. </my-abstract>

<title>Allegory</title>
<wiki-abstract> As a literary device, an allegory is a narrative in which a character, place, or event is used to deliver a broader message about real-world issues and occurrences. Authors have used allegory throughout history in all forms of art to illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> This further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis, as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention.Like allegorical stories, allegorical poetry has two meanings xe2x80x93 a literal meaning and a symbolic meaning.Some unique specimens of allegory can be found in the following works:Some elaborate and successful specimens of allegory are to be found in the following works, arranged in approximate chronological order:File:Melencolia I (Durero).jpg|Albrecht Dxc3xbcrer, Melencolia& I (1514): Unused tools, an hourglass, an empty scale surround a female personification, with other esoteric and exoteric symbols.File:Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpg|Bronzino, Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time (c. 1545): The deities of love are surrounded by personifications of (probably) Time (a bald, man with angry eyes), Folly (the young woman-demon on the right, possibly also so old woman on the left), and others.File:Titian - Allegorie der Zeit.jpg|Titian, Allegory of Prudence (c.& 1565xe2x80x931570): The three human heads symbolise past, present and future, the characterisation of which is furthered by the triple-headed beast (wolf, lion, dog), girded by the body of a big snake.File:Elizabeth-I-Allegorical-Po.jpg|The English School's Allegory of Queen Elizabeth (c. 1610), with Father Time at her right and Death looking over her left shoulder.Many allegories use personification of abstract concepts.First attested in English in 1382, the word allegory comes from Latin allegoria, the  latinisation of the Greek xe1xbcx80xcexbbxcexbbxcexb7xcexb3xcexbfxcfx81xcexafxcexb1 (allegorxc3xada), "veiled language, figurative", which originates from xe1xbcx80xcexb3xcexbfxcfx81xcexac (agora), "assembly".[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29gora%2F xe1xbcx80xcexb3xcexbfxcfx81xcexac], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, in the Perseus Digital Library.Northrop Frye discussed what he termed a "continuum of allegory", a spectrum that ranges from what he termed the "naive allegory" of the likes of The Faerie Queene, to the more private allegories of modern paradox literature.In this perspective, the characters in a "naive" allegory are not fully three-dimensional, for each aspect of their individual personalities and of the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction; the author has selected the allegory first, and the details merely flesh it out.The origins of allegory can be traced at least back to Homer in his "quasi-allegorical" use of personifications of, e.g., Terror (Deimos) and Fear (Phobos) at Il. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> alternative medicine is taught in more than half of US medical schools and US health insurers are increasingly willing to provide reimbursement for alternative therapies.Complementary medicine (CM) or integrative medicine (IM) is when alternative medicine is used together with functional medical treatment, in a belief that it improves the effect of treatments.CAM is an abbreviation of the phrase complementary and alternative medicine.Traditional medicine refers to the pre-scientific practices of a certain culture, in contrast to what is typically practiced in cultures where medical science dominates.The terms alternative medicine, complementary medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, natural medicine, unorthodox medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine, and new age medicine are used interchangeably as having the same meaning, and are almost synonymous in most contexts.}}Mainly as a result of reforms following the Flexner Report of 1910By 2001 some form of CAM training was being offered by at least 75 out of 125 medical schools in the US.There is a general scientific consensus that alternative therapies lack the requisite scientific validation, and their effectiveness is either unproved or disproved.The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine points to confusions in the general population& xe2x80x93 a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise-ineffective therapy just because they are taking something (the placebo effect); the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the regression fallacy) gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken; a person not diagnosed with science-based medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category.Edzard Ernst characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negativeIn 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a meta-analysis.Different cultures may have their own unique traditional or belief based practices developed recently or over thousands of years, and specific practices or entire systems of practices.Alternative medicine, such as using naturopathy or homeopathy in place of conventional medicine, is based on belief systems not grounded in science.{| class="wikitable""They told me if I took 1000 pills at night I should be quite another thing in the morning", an early 19th-century satire on Morison's Vegetable Pills, an alternative medicine supplement.Alternative medical systems may be based on traditional medicine practices, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda in India, or practices of other cultures around the world.Loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not, e.g., the use of the expressions "Western medicine" and "Eastern medicine" to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the Asiatic east and the European west, rather than that the difference is between evidence-based medicine and treatments that do not work.Alternative medicine is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of medicine,|name=IOMquote|group=n}} but whose effectiveness has not been established using scientific methods,Some other definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare.The existence of such energy fields have been disproven.#* Bioelectromagnetic-based therapies use verifiable electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, alternating-current, or direct-current fields in a non-scientific manner.The history of alternative medicine may refer to the history of a group of diverse medical practices that were collectively promoted as "alternative medicine" beginning in the 1970s, to the collection of individual histories of members of that group, or to the history of western medical practices that were labeled "irregular practices" by the western medical establishment.Use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise following the counterculture movement of the 1960s, as part of the rising new age movement of the 1970s. </my-abstract>

<title>Archimedean solid</title>
<wiki-abstract> In geometry, an Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes.  They are the convex uniform polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices, excluding the five Platonic solids (which are composed of only one type of polygon) and excluding the prisms and antiprisms. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Oregon is a fusion voting state, and the party has cross-nominated legislators and statewide officeholders using this method; its 2016 presidential preference primary did not identify a potential nominee due to no candidate earning more than 32% support.It is also used in internal elections by the American Solidarity Party,In 2018, Fargo, North Dakota passed a ballot initiative adopting approval voting for local elections, becoming the first United States city and jurisdiction to adopt approval voting.The idea of approval was adopted by X. Hu and Lloyd Shapley in 2003 in studying authority distribution in organizations.Approval voting has been adopted by several learned societies: the Society for Social Choice and Welfare (1992),Approval voting was used for Dartmouth Alumni Association elections for seats on the College Board of Trustees, but after some controversyApproval voting also can be used in social scenarios as a fairer, but still quick system compared to a First-Past-The-Post equivalent, being able to avoid a spoiler effect while being very quick to calculate.Approval voting advocates Steven Brams and Dudley R. Herschbach predict that approval voting should increase voter participation, prevent minor-party candidates from being spoilers, and reduce negative campaigning.In this way, there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates, although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable.For example, in this scenario, voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% (bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate):C wins with 65% of the voters' approval, beating B with 60%, D with 40% and A with 35%If voters' threshold for receiving a vote is that the candidate has an above average approval, or they vote for their two most approved of candidates, this is not a dichotomous cutoff, as this can change if candidates drop out.When there are three or more candidates, every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates.Based on the definition above, if there are four candidates, A, B, C, and D, and a voter has a strict preference order, preferring A to B to C to D, then the following are the voter's possible sincere approval votes:If the voter instead equally prefers B and C, while A is still the most preferred candidate and D is the least preferred candidate, then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote:The decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary "approval cutoff."Although approval voting differs from the voting system used in the Burr dilemma, approval voting can still leave candidates and voters with the generalized dilemma of whether to compete or cooperate.Approval voting allows voters to select all the candidates who they consider reasonable choices.Strategic approval voting differs from ranked choice voting methods where voters might reverse the preference order of two options, which if done on a larger scale causes an unpopular candidate to win. </my-abstract>

<title>ASCII art</title>
<wiki-abstract> ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 7-bit ASCII). The term is also loosely used to refer to text based visual art in general. </wiki-abstract>

The Commodore 64, which was released in 1982, also did not follow the ASCII standard. The C-64 character set is called PETSCII, an extended form of ASCII-1963. As with the Atari's ATASCII art, C-64 fans developed a similar scene that used PETSCII for their creations.
 , 
So-called "block ASCII" or "high ASCII" uses the extended characters of the 8-bit code page 437, which is a proprietary standard introduced by IBM in 1979 (ANSI Standard x3.16) for the IBM PC DOS and MS-DOS operating systems. "Block ASCIIs" were widely used on the PC during the 1990s until the Internet replaced BBSes as the main communication platform. Until then, "block ASCIIs" dominated the PC Text Art Scene.
The first art scene group that focused on the extended character set of the PC in their art work was called "Aces of ANSI Art" (<A.A.A>). Some members left in 1990, and formed a group called "ANSI Creators in Demand" (ACiD). In that same year the second major underground art scene group was founded, ICE, "Insane Creators Enterprise".
There is some debate between ASCII and block ASCII artist, with "Hardcore" ASCII artists maintaining that block ASCII art is in fact not ANSI art, because it does not use the 128 characters of the original ASCII standard. On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.
Microsoft Windows does not support the ANSI Standard x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font "Terminal", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see ASCII and ANSI art viewers), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that illustrates the difference in appearance is part of this article. Alternatively, one could look at the file using the TYPE command in the command prompt.

<my-abstract> This section mostly refers to such General American features.Studies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply deviate away from period British English, but is conservative in some ways, preserving certain features contemporary British English has since lost.Rhoticity is common in most American accents (yet nowadays rare in England), because, during the 17th-century British colonization, nearly all dialects of English were rhotic, and most North American English simply remained that way.For those American accents that have not undergone the cotxe2x80x93caught merger (the lexical sets  and ), they have instead retained a xe2x80x93 split: a 17th-century split in which certain words (labeled as the  lexical set) separated away from the  set.American English also favors the double quotation mark ("like this") over single ('as here'). While written American English is largely standardized across the country and spoken American English dialects are highly mutually intelligible, there are still several recognizable regional and ethnic accents and lexical distinctions.The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of "both convergence and divergence": some accents are homogenizing and leveling, while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another.Having been settled longer than the American West Coast, the East Coast has had more time to develop unique accents, and it currently comprises three or four linguistically significant regions, each of which possesses English varieties both different from each other as well as quite internally diverse: New England, the Mid-Atlantic States (including a New York accent as well as a unique Philadelphiaxe2x80x93Baltimore accent), and the South. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> The Africa Alphabet (also International African Alphabet or IAI alphabet) was developed by the  International Institute of African Languages and Cultures in 1928, with the help of some Africans led by Diedrich Hermann Westermann, who served as director of the organization from 1926 until 1939. Meanwhile, the aim of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, later known as International African Institute (IAI), was to enable people to write all the African languages for practical and scientific purposes without the need of diacritics. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> It is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet with a few differences, such as j and y, which instead have the same (consonant) sound values as in English.This alphabet has influenced development of orthographies of many African languages (serving "as the basis for the transcription" of about 60, by one count), but not all, and discussions of harmonization of systems of transcription that led to, among other things, adoption of the African reference alphabet.The African Alphabet was used, with the International Phonetic Alphabet, as a basis for the World Orthography.' </my-abstract>

<title>Adaptive radiation</title>
<wiki-abstract> In evolutionary biology, adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental niches. Starting with a single ancestor, this process results in the speciation and phenotypic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> European data is from the EARS-Net (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network), part of the ECDC.ResistanceMap is a website by the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy and provides data on antimicrobial resistance on a global level.Antibiotic stewardship programmes appear useful in reducing rates of antibiotic resistance.Antimicrobial stewardship teams in hospitals are encouraging optimal use of antimicrobials.Health workers and pharmacists can help tackle resistance by: enhancing infection prevention and control; only prescribing and dispensing antibiotics when they are truly needed; prescribing and dispensing the right antibiotic(s) to treat the illness.People can help tackle resistance by using antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor; completing the full prescription, even if they feel better; never sharing antibiotics with others or using leftover prescriptions.An increase in hand washing compliance by hospital staff results in decreased rates of resistant organisms.Water supply and sanitation infrastructure in health facilities offer significant co-benefits for combatting AMR, and investment should be increased.Manufacturers of antimicrobials need to improve the treatment of their wastewater (by using industrial wastewater treatment processes) to reduce the release of residues into the environment.In 1997, European Union health ministers voted to ban avoparcin and four additional antibiotics used to promote animal growth in 1999.The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collect data on antibiotic use in humans and in a more limited fashion in animals.For 2017, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) are together calling for responsible use of antibiotics in humans and animals to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance.United NationsIn 2016 the Secretary-General of the United Nations convened the Interagency Coordination Group (IACG) on Antimicrobial Resistance.# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do not require para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of folic acid and nucleic acids in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.# Ribosome splitting and recycling: for example, drug-mediated stalling of the ribosome by lincomycin and erythromycin unstalled by a heat shock protein found in Listeria monocytogenes, which is a homologue of HflX from other bacteria.Furthermore, if the use of vaccines increases, there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease; the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs.Alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b'      DESCRIPTION: Molecule triggering an immune response (antibody production) in the host.In immunology, an antigen (Ag) is a molecule or molecular structure, such as may be present at the outside of a pathogen, that can be bound by an antigen-specific antibody or B cell antigen receptor.The antigen may originate from within the body ("self-antigen") or from the external environment ("non-self").Vaccines are examples of antigens in an immunogenic form, which are intentionally administered to a recipient to induce the memory function of adaptive immune system toward the antigens of the pathogen invading that recipient, with the seasonal flu virus as a common example.Paul Ehrlich coined the term antibody (in German Antikxc3xb6rper) in his side-chain theory at the end of the 19th century.Antigen-presenting cells present antigens in the form of peptides on histocompatibility molecules. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term "al-Qaeda".Former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as "the database", because it originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.The radical Islamist movement developed during the Islamic revival and the rise of the Islamist movement after the Iranian Revolution (1978-1979).Some have argued that the writings of Islamic author and thinker Sayyid Qutb, inspired the al-Qaeda organization.In the words of Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, a close college friend of bin Laden: .</ref>}}Qutb also influenced bin Laden's mentor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.The Afghan jihad against the pro-Soviet government further developed the Salafist Jihadist movement which inspired Al-Qaeda.Abdel Bari Atwan wrote that:Following its 9/11 attack and in response to its condemnation by Islamic scholars, Al-Qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, "A Statement from Qaidat al-Jihad Regarding the Mandates of the Heroes and the Legality of the Operations in New York and Washington".Rumsfeld proposed hi-tech ground sensors along the Line of Control to prevent militants from infiltrating into Indian-administered Kashmir.An investigation in 2002 found evidence that al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence.US officials believe that al-Qaeda was helping organize attacks in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan.Maulana Masood Azhar, the founder of Kashmiri group Jaish-e-Mohammed, is believed to have met bin Laden several times and received funding from him.Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind 2008 Mumbai attacks, is also known to have strong ties to senior al-Qaeda leaders living in Pakistan.In a video released in 2008, American-born senior al-Qaeda operative Adam Yahiye Gadahn stated that "victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which, Allah willing, will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land.Experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented into a number of disparate regional movements, and that these groups bear little connection with one another.This view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with Tayseer Allouni:Bruce Hoffman, however, sees al-Qaeda as a cohesive network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas.Al-Qaeda has the following direct affiliates:The following are presently believed to be indirect affiliates of al-Qaeda:Osama bin Laden served as the emir of al-Qaeda from the organization's founding in 1988 until his assassination by US forces on May 1, 2011.The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.In the 1990s, financing for al-Qaeda came partly from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden.Among the first pieces of evidence regarding Saudi Arabia's support for al-Qaeda was the so-called "Golden Chain", a list of early al-Qaeda funders seized during a 2002 raid in Sarajevo by Bosnian police.The US Treasury has stated that Nuaimi "has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qaeda in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qaeda in Iraq and Qatar-based donors".Nuaimi was accused of overseeing a $2& million monthly transfer to al-Qaeda in Iraq as part of his role as mediator between Iraq-based al-Qaeda senior officers and Qatari citizens.Another Qatari citizen, Kalifa Mohammed Turki Subayi, was sanctioned by the US Treasury on June 5, 2008, for his activities as a "Gulf-based al-Qaeda financier".Al-Qaeda defector al-Fadl, who was a former member of Qatar Charity, testified in court that Abdullah Mohammed Yusef, who served as Qatar Charity's director, was affiliated to al-Qaeda and simultaneously to the National Islamic Front, a political group that gave al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden harbor in Sudan in the early 1990s.Legal proceedings from the trial United States vs. Enaam M. Arnaout revealed that Qatar Charity was cited by Bin Laden in 1993 as one of the charities used to channel financial support to al-Qaeda operatives overseas.The US State Department released a videotape showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.In September 2004, the 9/11 Commission officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives.By the end of 2004, the US government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-Qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the CIA: Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in 2002; Mohammed Atef and several others were killed.From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.Islamist rebels in the Sahara calling themselves al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years.In Mali, the Ansar Dine faction was also reported as an ally of al-Qaeda in 2013.Following the Libyan Civil War, the removal of Gaddafi and the ensuing period of post-civil war violence in Libya, various Islamist militant groups affiliated with al-Qaeda were able to expand their operations in the region. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, allowing barge traffic up the Arkansas River to the Port of Catoosa in Tulsa, Oklahoma.There are four airports with commercial service: Clinton National Airport (formerly Little Rock National Airport or Adams Field), Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport, Fort Smith Regional Airport, and Texarkana Regional Airport, with dozens of smaller airports in the state.Public transit and community transport services for the elderly or those with developmental disabilities are provided by agencies such as the Central Arkansas Transit Authority and the Ozark Regional Transit, organizations that are part of the Arkansas Transit Association.As with the federal government of the United States, political power in Arkansas is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.Before his presidency, Clinton served as the 40th and 42nd governor of Arkansas, a total of nearly 12 years.Little Rock has been Arkansas's capital city since 1821 when it replaced Arkansas Post as the capital of the Territory of Arkansas.The Fayettevillexe2x80x93Springdalexe2x80x93Rogers Metropolitan Area is the second-largest metropolitan area in Arkansas, growing at the fastest rate due to the influx of businesses and the growth of the University of Arkansas and Walmart.}}The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Arkansas was 3,017,804 on July 1, 2019, a 3.49% increase since the 2010 United States Census.As of 2019, Arkansas has an estimated population of 3,017,804.The capital was relocated from Arkansas Post to Little Rock in 1821, during the territorial period.When Arkansas applied for statehood, the slavery issue was again raised in Washington, D.C.. Congress eventually approved the Arkansas Constitution after a 25-hour session, admitting Arkansas on June 15, 1836, as the 25th state and the 13th slave state, having a population of about 60,000.Arkansas was the last state of the old Confederacy to never have Republicans control either chamber of its house since the Civil War.Arkansas's judicial branch has five court systems: Arkansas Supreme Court, Arkansas Court of Appeals, Circuit Courts, District Courts and City Courts.Most cases begin in district court, which is subdivided into state district court and local district court.In 1881, the Arkansas General Assembly passed Arkansas Code 1-4-105 (official text):Citizens of the state of Kansas often pronounce the Arkansas River as , in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.Settlers, such as fur trappers, moved to Arkansas in the early 18th century.The Buffalo National River has been preserved in its natural state by the National Park Service and is frequented by fly fishers annually.As of 2012, Arkansas, as with many Southern states, has a high incidence of premature death, infant mortality, cardiovascular deaths, and occupational fatalities compared to the rest of the United States.Healthcare in Arkansas is provided by a network of hospitals as members of the Arkansas Hospital Association. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> An etymology for this name is presented by B. Farahvashi to be derived from the Persian word "ab" (water) and the root "pxc4x81" (guard, watch) thus "coastguard station").In Islamic times, a pseudo-etymology was produced by the historian Ahmad ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri (d. 892) quoting a folk story that the town was presumably founded by one "Abbad bin Hosayn" from the Arabian Tribe of Banu Tamim, who established a garrison there during the governorship of Hajjaj in the Ummayad period.In the subsequent centuries, the Persian version of the name had begun to come into general use before it was adopted by official decree in 1935.The civilian population of the city dropped close to zero during the eight years of the Iranxe2x80x93Iraq War (1980xe2x80x931988).Prior to the war, the city's civilian population was about 300,000, but at the war's end nearly the entire populace had sought refuge elsewhere in Iran.After the war, the biggest concern was the rebuilding of Abadan's oil refinery, as it was operating at 10% of capacity due to damage.To honor the 100th anniversary of the refining of oil in Abadan, city officials are planning an oil museum. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> With the fortune he made from business, he built Carnegie Hall in New York, NY, and the Peace Palace and founded the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Carnegie Institution for Science, Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, Carnegie Hero Fund, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, among others.Andrew Carnegie was born to Margaret Morrison Carnegie and William Carnegie in Dunfermline, Scotland, in a typical weaver's cottage with only one main room, consisting of half the ground floor, which was shared with the neighboring weaver's family.Carnegie's maternal uncle, George Lauder, Sr., a Scottish political leader, deeply influenced him as a boy by introducing him to the writings of Robert Burns and historical Scottish heroes such as Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, and Rob Roy.In addition to Triumphant Democracy (1886) and The Gospel of Wealth (1889), he also wrote Our Coaching Trip, Brighton to Inverness (1882), An American Four-in-hand in Britain (1883), Round the World (1884), The Empire of Business (1902), The Secret of Business is the Management of Men (1903),According to biographer Burton J. Hendrick:Hendrick argues that:Carnegie's personal papers are at the Library of Congress Manuscript Division.The Carnegie Collections of the Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library consist of the archives of the following organizations founded by Carnegie: The Carnegie Corporation of New York (CCNY); The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP); the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT);The Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs (CCEIA).He also donated xc2xa350,000 to help set up the University of Birmingham in 1899.File:Hornell library.jpg|Carnegie Library, Hornell, NYFile:Macomb Public Library.JPG|Carnegie library, Macomb, IllinoisFile:Edinburgh Central Library, George IV Bridge.JPG|Edinburgh Central LibraryFile:Yorkville Library.jpg|Yorkville Library, Ontario.File:Syracuse Carnegie Library.jpg|Carnegie Library at Syracuse UniversityIn 1900, Carnegie gave $2 million to start the Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) at Pittsburgh and the same amount in 1902 to found the Carnegie Institution at Washington, D.C.Carnegie is extolled as a "lover of the world of humanity and one of the founders of Universal Peace".[[File:Stamp-andrew-carnegie.jpg|thumb|Carnegie commemorated as an industrialist, philanthropist, and founder of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1960]] Influenced by his "favorite living hero in public life" John Bright, Carnegie started his efforts in pursuit of world peace at a young age, His motto, "All is well since all grows better", served not only as a good rationalization of his successful business career, but also his view of international relations.Despite his efforts towards international peace, Carnegie faced many dilemmas on his quest.Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, for example, Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy, but he opposed American oversea expansion.Despite that, Carnegie served as a major donor for the newly-established International Court of Arbitration's Peace Palace xe2x80x93 brainchild of Russian Tsar Nicolas II.His largest and in the long run most influential peace organization was the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, formed in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.Carnegie also served on the Boards of Cornell University and Stevens Institute of Technology.In 1911, Carnegie became a sympathetic benefactor to George Ellery Hale, who was trying to build the  Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson, and donated an additional ten million dollars to the Carnegie Institution with the following suggestion to expedite the construction of the telescope: "I hope the work at Mount Wilson will be vigorously pushed, because I am so anxious to hear the expected results from it. </my-abstract>

<title>Approximant</title>
<wiki-abstract> Approximants are speech sounds that involve the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough nor with enough articulatory precision, citing  to create turbulent airflow. Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> This class is composed of sounds like  (as in rest) and semivowels like  and  (as in yes and west, respectively), as well as lateral approximants like  (as in less).Before Peter Ladefoged coined the term "approximant" in the 1960s, the term "frictionless continuant" referred to non-lateral approximants.In phonology, "approximant" is also a distinctive feature that encompasses all sonorants except nasals, including vowels, taps and trills.Some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms semivowel and glide are often used for these non-syllabic vowel-like segments. </my-abstract>

<title>Aeon</title>
<wiki-abstract> The word aeon , also spelled eon (in American English), originally meant "life", "vital force" or "being", "generation" or "a period of time", though it tended to be translated as "age" in the sense of  "ages", "forever", "timeless" or "for eternity". It is a Latin transliteration from the koine Greek word   (aiwon). </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Aeon can also refer to the four aeons on the geologic time scale that make up the Earth's history, the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and the current aeon, Phanerozoic.In astronomy an aeon is defined as a billion years (10<sup>9</sup> years, abbreviated AE). Roger Penrose uses the word aeon to describe the period between successive and cyclic Big Bangs within the context of conformal cyclic cosmology.Plato used the word aeon to denote the eternal world of ideas, which he conceived was "behind" the perceived world, as demonstrated in his famous allegory of the cave.Christianity's idea of "eternal life" comes from the word for life, zoe, and a form of aeon, which could mean life in the next aeon, the Kingdom of God, or Heaven, just as much as immortality, as in .According to the Christian doctrine of universal reconciliation, the Greek New Testament scriptures use the word "aeon" to mean a long period (perhaps 1000 years) and the word "aeonian" to mean "during a long period"; Thus there was a time before the aeons, and the aeonian period is finite. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Among the first Asian carriers during the era were Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong (founded in September 1946), Orient Airways (later Pakistan International Airlines; founded in October 1946), Air Ceylon (later SriLankan Airlines; founded in 1947), Malayan Airways Limited in 1947 (later Singapore and Malaysia Airlines), El Al in Israel in 1948, Garuda Indonesia in 1949, Japan Airlines in 1951, Thai Airways in 1960, and Korean National Airlines in 1947.Singapore Airlines had won quality awards.Among the first countries to have regular airlines in Latin America and the Caribbean were Bolivia with Lloyd Axc3xa9reo Boliviano, Cuba with Cubana de Aviacixc3xb3n, Colombia with Avianca (the first airline established in the Americas), Argentina with Aerolineas Argentinas, Chile with LAN Chile (today LATAM Airlines), Brazil with Varig, Dominican Republic with Dominicana de Aviacixc3xb3n, Mexico with Mexicana de Aviacixc3xb3n, Trinidad and Tobago with BWIA West Indies Airways (today Caribbean Airlines), Venezuela with Aeropostal, Puerto Rico with Puertorriquena; and TACA based in El Salvador and representing several airlines of Central America (Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua).This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.Over January/February 2018, the cheapest airline surveyed by price comparator rome2rio was now-defunct Tigerair Australia with $0.06/km followed by AirAsia X with $0.07/km, while the most expensive was Charterlines, Inc. with $1.26/km followed by Buddha Air with $1.18/km.For the IATA, the global airline industry revenue was $754 billion in 2017 for a $38.4 billion collective profit, and should rise by 10.7% to $834 billion in 2018 for a $33.8 billion profit forecast, down by 12% due to rising jet fuel and labor costs.The demand for air transport will be less elastic for longer flights than for shorter flights, and more elastic for leisure travel than for business travel.Airlines often have a strong seasonality, with traffic low in winter and peaking in summer.Flight crew members include: Pilots (Captain and First Officer: some older aircraft also required a Flight Engineer and/or a Navigator); Flight attendants (led by a purser on larger aircraft); In-flight security personnel on some airlines (most notably El Al)Groundcrew, responsible for operations at airports, include Aerospace and avionics engineers responsible for certifying the aircraft for flight and management of aircraft maintenance; Aerospace engineers, responsible for airframe, powerplant and electrical systems maintenance; Avionics engineers responsible for avionics and instruments maintenance; Airframe and powerplant technicians; Electric System technicians, responsible for maintenance of electrical systems; Flight dispatchers; Baggage handlers; Ramp Agents; Remote centralised weight and balancing; Gate agents; Ticket agents; Passenger service agents (such as airline lounge employees); Reservation agents, usually (but not always) at facilities outside the airport; Crew schedulers.Airlines follow a corporate structure where each broad area of operations (such as maintenance, flight operations (including flight safety), and passenger service) is supervised by a vice president.Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit.In December 1991, the collapse of Pan Am, an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry, highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies.Following the 1978 deregulation, U.S. carriers did not manage to make an aggregate profit for 12 years in 31, including four years where combined losses amounted to $10 billion, but rebounded with eight consecutive years of profits since 2010, including its four with over $10 billion profits.Many other airlines are replicating Southwest's hedging policy to control their fuel costs.Operating costs for US major airlines are primarily aircraft operating expense including jet fuel, aircraft maintenance, depreciation and aircrew for 44%, servicing expense for 29% (traffic 11%, passenger 11% and aircraft 7%), 14% for reservations and sales and 13% for overheads (administration 6% and advertising 2%).U.S. airlines that have declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy since 1990 have included American Airlines, Continental Airlines (twice), Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Pan Am, United Airlines and US Airways (twice).Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport, then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or "hub") for its scheduled flights.Fuel hedging is a contractual tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. </my-abstract>

<title>Unit of alcohol</title>
<wiki-abstract> Units of alcohol are used in the United Kingdom (UK) as a measure to quantify the actual alcoholic content within a given volume of an alcoholic beverage, in order to provide guidance on total alcohol consumption. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Standard drinks were referred to in the first UK guidelines (1984) that published "safe limits" for drinking, but these were replaced by references to "alcohol units" in the 1987 guidelines and the latter term has been used in all subsequent UK guidance.As an approximate guideline, a typical healthy adult can metabolise (break down) about one unit of alcohol per hour, although this may vary depending on sex, age, weight, health and many other factors.The number of UK units of alcohol in a drink can be determined by multiplying <var>the volume of the drink (in millilitres)</var> by its <var>percentage ABV</var>, and dividing by 1000.For example, one imperial pint (568 ml) of beer at 4% alcohol by volume (ABV) contains:  568mbox{ ml} times 4% times frac{1mbox{ unit}}{10mbox{ ml}} && = && 568mbox{ ml} times frac{4}{100} times frac{1mbox{ unit}}{10mbox{ ml}} && = && 568mbox{ ml} times frac{4mbox{ units}}{1000mbox{ ml}} &= 2.3mbox{ units}end{align}</math>The formula uses .This results in exactly one unit per percentage point per litre, of any alcoholic beverage.The formula can be simplified for everyday use by expressing the serving size in centilitres and the alcohol content literally as a percentage:  75mbox{ cl} times 12% times frac{1mbox{ unit}}{1mbox{ cl}} && = && 75mbox{ cl} times frac{12}{100} times frac{1mbox{ unit}}{1mbox{ cl}} && = && 75 times frac{12}{100}mbox{ units} &= 9mbox{ units}end{align}</math>Thus, a 750& ml bottle of wine at 12% ABV contains 75& cl xc3x97 12% = 9 units. </my-abstract>

Board of Education, which led to the ban on racial segregation in US public schools.The ACLU regularly tackled police misconduct issues, starting with the 1932 case Powell v. Alabama (right to an attorney), and including 1942's Betts v. Brady (right to an attorney), and 1951's Rochin v. California (involuntary stomach pumping).Some of the most well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed in a string of cases limiting the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home.The 1960s was a tumultuous era in the United States, and public interest in civil liberties underwent an explosive growth.African-American protests in the South accelerated in the early 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step.The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.However, not all cases were victories; ACLU lost cases in 1949 and 1961 which challenged state laws requiring commercial businesses to close on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath.During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU continued its battle against censorship of art and literature.Cities across America routinely banned movies because they were deemed to be "harmful", "offensive", or "immoral"censorship which was validated by the 1915 Mutual v. Ohio Supreme Court decision which held movies to be mere commerce, undeserving of first amendment protection.The ACLU defended beat generation artists, including Allen Ginsberg who was prosecuted for his poem "Howl"; andin an unorthodox case the ACLU helped a coffee house regain its restaurant license which was revoked because its Beat customers were allegedly disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood.The ACLU lost an important press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines.This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.The ACLU's support of defendants with unpopular, sometimes extreme, viewpoints have produced many landmark court cases and established new civil liberties.The most important cases involved statutes requiring flag salutes.The rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany, Russia, and other countries who rejected freedom of speech and association had a large impact on the civil liberties movement in the US; anti-Communist sentiment rose and civil liberties were curtailed.The ACLU leadership was divided over whether or not to defend pro-Nazi speech in the United States; pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis.In the late 1930s, the ACLU allied itself with the Popular Front, a coalition of liberal organizations coordinated by the United States Communist Party.The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) was created in 1938 to uncover sedition and treason within the United States.By 1974, ACLU membership had reached 275,000.During those years, the ACLU led the way in expanding legal rights in three directions: new rights for persons within government-run "enclaves", new rights for victim groups, and privacy rights for mainstream citizens.The ACLU initiated the legal field of student's rights with the Tinker v. Des Moines case, and expanded it with cases such as Goss v. Lopez which required schools to provide students an opportunity to appeal suspensions.As early as 1945, the ACLU had taken a stand to protect the rights of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute governing mental commitments.Prior to 1960, prisoners had virtually no recourse to the court system, because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights.The ACLU played a key role in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.The Reproductive Freedom Project is an institution founded in 1974 (within the larger context of ACLU) that is committed to defend individuals who feel abused by the government, especially with cases pertaining to a lack of access to abortions, birth control, or sexual education.The ACLU continues to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly treated by the government.As referenced in the larger ACLU article, in 1929, the ACLU defended Margaret Sanger's right to educate the general public about forms of birth control.The suit was filed in support of the Westboro Baptist Church and Shirley Phelps-Roper, who were threatened with arrest.In 2009, the ACLU filed an amicus brief in Citizens United v. FEC, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 violated the First Amendment right to free speech by curtailing political speech.In 2010, the ACLU of Illinois was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community.In 2011, the ACLU started its Don't Filter Me project, countering LGBT-related Internet censorship in public schools in the United States.On January 7, 2013, the ACLU reached a settlement with the federal government in Collins v. United States that provided for the payment of full separation pay to servicemembers discharged under "don't ask, don't tell" since November 10, 2004, who had previously been granted only half that.When leftist singer Paul Robeson was denied a passport in 1950, even though he was not accused of any illegal acts, the ACLU chose to not defend him.In response to communist witch-hunts, many witnesses and employees chose to use the fifth amendment protection against self-incrimination to avoid divulging information about their political beliefs.The fifth amendment issue became the catalyst for a watershed event in 1954, which finally resolved the ACLU's ambivalence by ousting the anti-communists from ACLU leadership.McCarthyism declined in late 1954 after television journalist Edward R. Murrow and others publicly chastised McCarthy.The Supreme Court handed the ACLU two key victories in 1957, in Watkins v. United States and Yates v. United States, both of which undermined the Smith Act and marked the beginning of the end of communist party membership inquiries.The decade from 1954 to 1964 was the most successful period in the ACLU's history. </my-abstract>

<title>Apparent magnitude</title>
<wiki-abstract> Apparent magnitude () is a measure of the brightness of a star or other astronomical object observed from Earth. An object's apparent magnitude depends on its intrinsic luminosity, its distance from Earth, and any extinction of the object's light caused by interstellar dust along the line of sight to the observer. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The absolute magnitude <math>H</math>, diameter <math>D</math> (in kilometers) and geometric albedo <math>p</math> of a body are related byExample: The Moon's absolute magnitude <math>H</math> can be calculated from its diameter <math>D=3474text{ km}</math> and geometric albedo <math>p=0.113</math>:We have <math>d_{BS}=1text{ AU}</math>, <math>d_{BO}=384400text{ km}=0.00257text{ AU}.</math>At quarter phase, <math>q(alpha)approx frac{2}{3pi}</math> (according to the diffuse reflector model), this yields an apparent magnitude of <math>m=+0.28+5log_{10}{left(1cdot0.00257right)}-2.5log_{10}{left(frac{2}{3pi}right)}=-10.99.</math> The actual value is somewhat lower than that, <math>m=-10.0.</math> The phase curve of the Moon is too complicated for the diffuse reflector model.Because Solar System bodies are never perfect diffuse reflectors, astronomers use different models to predict apparent magnitudes based on known or assumed properties of the body.Its strength depends on the physical properties of the body's surface, and hence it differs from asteroid to asteroid.In 1985, the IAU adopted the semi-empirical <math>HG</math>-system, based on two parameters <math>H</math> and <math>G</math> called absolute magnitude and slope, to model the opposition effect for the ephemerides published by the Minor Planet Center.whereandThis relation is valid for phase angles <math>alpha<120^{circ}</math>, and works best when <math>alpha<20^{circ}</math>.The slope parameter <math>G</math> relates to the surge in brightness, typically , when the object is near opposition.Their brightness can be approximated aswhere <math>m_{1,2}</math> are the total and nuclear apparent magnitudes of the comet, respectively, <math>M_{1,2}</math> are its "absolute" total and nuclear magnitudes, <math>d_{BS}</math> and <math>d_{BO}</math> are the body-sun and body-observer distances, <math>d_{0}</math> is the Astronomical Unit, and <math>K_{1,2}</math> are the slope parameters characterising the comet's activity.To compare the magnitudes of very distant objects with those of local objects, a K correction might have to be applied to the magnitudes of the distant objects.The absolute magnitude  can also be written in terms of the apparent magnitude  and stellar parallax :or using apparent magnitude  and distance modulus :Rigel has a visual magnitude  of 0.12 and distance of about 860 light-years:Vega has a parallax  of 0.129xe2x80xb3, and an apparent magnitude  of 0.03:The Black Eye Galaxy has a visual magnitude  of 9.36 and a distance modulus  of 31.06:The bolometric magnitude , takes into account electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 flight, so the Manned Spacecraft Center designers rejected the explosive design in favor of a mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs.The board noted that the test planners had failed to identify the test as hazardous; the emergency equipment (such as gas masks) were inadequate to handle this type of fire; that fire, rescue, and medical teams were not in attendance; and that the spacecraft work and access areas contained many hindrances to emergency response such as steps, sliding doors, and sharp turns.When designing the Mercury spacecraft, NASA had considered using a nitrogen/oxygen mixture to reduce the fire risk near launch, but rejected it based on a number of considerations.Slayton replaced him with Chaffee,On September 29, Walter Schirra, Eisele, and Walter Cunningham were named as the prime crew for a second Block I CSM flight, AS-205.In March, NASA was studying the possibility of flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966.Grissom's crew received approval in June 1966 to design a mission patch with the name Apollo1 (though the approval was subsequently withdrawn pending a final decision on the mission designation, which wasn't resolved until after the fire).All crewed missions would use the Block II spacecraft, to which many command module design changes were made:Thorough protocols were implemented for documenting spacecraft construction and maintenance.The astronauts' widows asked that Apollo 1 be reserved for the flight their husbands never made, and on April 24, 1967, Mueller, as Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, announced this change officially: AS-204 would be recorded as Apollo1, "first crewed Apollo Saturn flight xe2x80x93 failed on ground test".He gave an oral presentation (with transparencies) of his team's findings to Mueller and Seamans, and also presented them in a memo to North American president John L. Atwood, to which Mueller appended his own strongly worded memo to Atwood.During Mondale's 1967 questioning about what was to become known as the "Phillips Report", Seamans was afraid Mondale might actually have seen a hard copy of Phillips' presentation, and responded that contractors have occasionally been subjected to on-site progress reviews; perhaps this was what Mondale's information referred to.On May 11, Webb issued a statement defending NASA's November 1961 selection of North American as the prime contractor for Apollo. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He trained with Conrad and Gordon as part of the backup crew for what would be the Apollo 9 mission, and would have been assigned as lunar module pilot for Apollo 12.The Apollo 12 command module Yankee Clipper is on display at the Virginia Air and Space Center in Hampton, Virginia.In 2002, astronomers thought they might have discovered another moon orbiting Earth, which they designated J002E3, that turned out to be the S-IVB third stage of the Apollo 12 SaturnV rocket.The Lunar Module Intrepid impacted the Moon November 20, 1969, at 22:17:17.7 UT (5:17pm EST) .The Apollo 12 third stage, an S-IVB<!-- S-IVB-507, according to the S-IVB article -->, after passing the Moon on 18 November 1969 and not entering a Lunar orbit like the Command Module and Lunar Lander, entered an elliptical Earth orbit with a period of approximately 43 days,Notably, in April 2002, it reentered a temporary orbit around the Earth-Moon system near the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian pointxe2x80x94"a location where the gravity of the Earth and Sun approximately cancel"Portions of the Apollo 12 mission are dramatized in the 1998 miniseries From the Earth to the Moon episode entitled "That's All There Is."The seismometers the astronauts had left on the lunar surface registered the vibrations for more than an hour.The crew stayed an extra day in lunar orbit taking photographs, for a total lunar surface stay of 31 and a half hours and a total time in lunar orbit of eighty-nine hours.On the return flight to Earth after leaving lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo 12 witnessed (and photographed) a solar eclipse, though this one was of the Earth eclipsing the Sun.Yankee Clipper returned to Earth on November 24, 1969, at 20:58 UTC (3:58pm EST, 10:58am HST), in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 500 nautical miles (800& km) east of American Samoa. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The crew originally designated for Apollo 14, Jim Lovell as the commander, Ken Mattingly as CMP and Fred Haise as LMP, all of whom had backed up Apollo 11, was made the prime crew for Apollo 13 instead.Mitchell's commander on the Apollo 10 backup crew had been another of the original seven, Gordon Cooper, who had tentatively been scheduled to command Apollo 13, but according to author Andrew Chaikin, his casual attitude toward training resulted in his nonselection.The PSE had been flown on Apollo 12 and 13, the ASE on Apollo 13, the SIDE on Apollo 12, the CCIG on Apollo 12 and 13 and the LRRR on Apollo 11.For Apollo 14, they were: Pete Frank, Orange team; Glynn Lunney, Black team; Milt Windler, Maroon team and Gerry Griffin, Gold team.Prime and backup crews for both Apollo 13 and 14 were announced on August 6, 1969.The investigation into the accident which caused an abort of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14.Also considered part of the spacecraft were the Launch Escape System and the Spacecraft/Launch Vehicle Adapter.The changes to the Apollo spacecraft between Apollo 13 and 14 were more numerous than with earlier missions, not only because of the problems with Apollo 13, but because of the more extensive lunar activities planned for Apollo 14. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It was these formations that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this hypothesis was proven incorrect by the composition of lunar samples from the mission.In preparing for their mission, in addition to the usual Apollo spacecraft training, Young and Duke, along with backup commander Fred Haise, underwent an extensive geological training program that included several field trips to introduce them to concepts and techniques they would use in analyzing features and collecting samples on the lunar surface. </my-abstract>

<title>American Revolution</title>
<wiki-abstract> The American Revolution was an ideological and political revolution which occurred in colonial North America between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern democracy. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Americans heavily used Montesquieu's analysis of the wisdom of the "balanced" British Constitution (mixed government) in writing the state and national constitutions.The American ideology called "republicanism" was inspired by the Whig party in Great Britain which openly criticized the corruption within the British government.The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton, which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires.The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775xe2x80x931783), gaining independence from the British Crown and establishing the United States of America, the first modern democracy.American colonists objected to being taxed by the British Parliament, a body in which they had no direct representation.Behind them, much of the territory that they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic guerrilla war, fought predominantly between bands of Loyalists and American militia, which negated many of the gains that the British had previously made.The British army under Cornwallis marched to Yorktown, Virginia, where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet.Historians continue to debate whether the odds were long or short for American victory.Lord Germain took a hard line, but the British generals on American soil never held treason trials and treated captured American soldiers as prisoners of war.The capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally enter the war in support of Congress, and Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent military alliance in early 1778; France thus became the first foreign nation to officially recognize the Declaration of Independence.Some argue that the economic impact was minimal on the colonists,King Philip's War ended in 1678, which the New England colonies fought without any military assistance from England, and this contributed to the development of a unique identity separate from that of the British people. Some writers begin their histories of the American Revolution with the British coalition victory in the Seven Years' War in 1763, viewing the French and Indian War as though it were the American theater of the Seven Years' War.The British government believed that they could overawe the Americans by sending a large military and naval force, forcing them to be loyal again:Washington forced the British out of Boston in the spring of 1776, and neither the British nor the Loyalists controlled any significant areas.The other colonies rallied behind Massachusetts, and a group of American Patriot leaders set up their own government in late 1774 at the Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance of Britain; other colonists retained their allegiance to the Crown and were known as Loyalists or Tories.Open warfare erupted when British regulars sent to capture a cache of military supplies were confronted by local Patriot militia at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775.John Murrin, by contrast, argues that the definition of "the people" at that time was mostly restricted to free men who passed a property qualification.After the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics became possible in the former colonies.The Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain, was the next country to sign a treaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782.The American Revolution was the first wave of the Atlantic Revolutions: the French Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, and the Latin American wars of independence. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Throughout his writing career, all but four of his plays were premiered at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough in its three different locations.Ayckbourn received the CBE in 1987 that Alan Ayckbourn is the most performed living English playwright, and the second most performed of all time after Shakespeare.Although Ayckbourn's plays no longer dominate the theatrical scene on the scale of his earlier works, he continues to write, his most recent major success being Private Fears in Public Places that had a hugely successful Off-Broadway run at 59E59 Theaters, and in 2006 was made into a film Cxc5x93urs, directed by Alain Resnais.Many of Ayckbourn's plays have had their New York premiere at 59E59 Theaters as part of their annual Brits Off Broadway Festitval including Private Fears in Public Places, Intimate Exchanges, My Wonderful Day and Neighbourhood Watch among others.Although Ayckbourn is best known as a writer, it is said that he only spends 10% of his time writing plays.and returned in 1987 to direct the premiere of Henceforward....He announced in 1999 that he would step back from directing the work of other playwrights, to concentrate on his own plays,In 2002, following a dispute over the Duchess Theatre's handling of Damsels in Distress, Ayckbourn sharply criticised both this and the West End's treatment of theatre in general, in particular their casting of celebrities.He announced in June 2007 that he would retire as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre after the 2008 season.In March 2010 he directed an in-the-round revival of his play Taking Steps at the Orange Tree Theatre, winning universal press acclaim.In July 2014, Ayckbourn directed a musical adaptation of The Boy Who Fell into A Book, with musical adaptation and lyrics by Paul James and music by Eric Angus and Cathy Shostak. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Note: the name is not in either source; and it is not yet a claimed discovery.--> Like the probably spurious Alpha Centauri Bb, it likely has lakes of molten lava and would be far too close to Alpha Centauri B to harbour life.Additional planets may exist in the Alpha Centauri system, either orbiting Alpha Centauri& A or Alpha Centauri& B individually, or in large orbits around Alpha Centauri AB.This would be discounted if, for example, Alpha Centauri& B happened to have gas giants orbiting Alpha Centauri& A (or vice versa), or if Alpha Centauri A and B themselves were able to perturb comets into each other's inner system as Jupiter and Saturn presumably have done in the Solar System.To be in the habitable zone, a planet around Alpha Centauri A would have an orbital radius of between about 1 and  so as to have similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to exist.A line drawn through them points to the four bright stars of the [[Southern Cross, just to the right of the dome of the Danish 1.54-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile.some 4.5xc2xb0 west,South of about 29xc2xb0 S latitude, Alpha Centauri is circumpolar and never sets below the horizon.As seen from Earth, Proxima Centauri is 2.2xc2xb0 southwest from Alpha Centauri AB, about four times the angular diameter of the Moon.Alpha Centauri is inside the G-cloud, and its nearest known system is the binary brown dwarf system Luhman 16 at ., but it has decreased by a fraction of a degree since Ptolemy's time due to proper motion.)These showed large proper motion and parallax similar in both size and direction to those of Alpha Centauri AB, suggesting that Proxima Centauri is part of the Alpha Centauri system and slightly closer to Earth than Alpha Centauri AB. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In 2006, PC World rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating "Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer".Commodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the Amiga 2000 in 1987, the Amiga 3000 in 1990, and the Amiga 4000 in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options.These new designs were released in 1987 as the Amiga 2000 and Amiga 500, the latter of which went on to widespread success and became their best selling model.Similar high-end/low-end models would make up the Amiga line for the rest of its history; follow-on designs included the Amiga 3000/Amiga 500 Plus/Amiga 600, and the Amiga 4000/Amiga 1200.The company was renamed to Met@box in 1999 until it folded.The NatAmi (short for Native Amiga) hardware project began in 2005 with the aim of designing and building an Amiga clone motherboard that is enhanced with modern features.In 2006, two new Amiga clones were announced, both using FPGA based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga OCS custom chipset.The Amiga 500+ (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the Amiga 600 (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.The CDTV, launched in 1991, was a CD-ROM based all-in-one multimedia system.As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.Like many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been emulated so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware.The current owner of the trademark, Amiga, Inc., licensed the rights to sell hardware using either the Amiga or AmigaOne brand to Eyetech Group, Hyperion Entertainment and Commodore USA.Amiga 1000Amiga 600Amiga 1200Amiga CD32Disk containing the Deluxe Paint bitmap graphics editorAt its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several coprocessors, which handle audio, video and direct memory access independently of the Central Processing Unit (CPU). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The I stands for ideal: if two polynomials f and g both vanish on U, then f+g vanishes on U, and if h is any polynomial, then hf vanishes on U, so I(U) is always an ideal of the polynomial ring k[A<sup>n</sup>].Two natural questions to ask are:The answer to the first question is provided by introducing the Zariski topology, a topology on A<sup>n</sup> whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of k[A<sup>n</sup>].Initially a study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off, and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.In the 20th century, algebraic geometry split into several subareas.Much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on "intrinsic" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in topology, differential and complex geometry.On the other hand, the definitions extend naturally to projective varieties (next section), as an affine variety and its projective completion have the same field of functions.If V is an affine variety, its coordinate ring is an integral domain and has thus a field of fractions which is denoted k(V) and called the field of the rational functions on V or, shortly, the function field of V. Its elements are the restrictions to V of the rational functions over the affine space containing V. The domain of a rational function f is not V but the complement of the subvariety (a hypersurface) where the denominator of f vanishes.As with regular maps, one may define a rational map from a variety V to a variety V<nowiki>'</nowiki>.The property of a function to be polynomial (or regular) does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system in A<sup>n</sup>.When a coordinate system is chosen, the regular functions on the affine n-space may be identified with the ring of polynomial functions in n variables over k. Therefore, the set of the regular functions on A<sup>n</sup> is a ring, which is denoted k[A<sup>n</sup>].We say that a polynomial vanishes at a point if evaluating it at that point gives zero.Choose m regular functions on V, and call them f determines one coordinate of the range of f.If Vxe2x80xb2 is a variety contained in A<sup>m</sup>, we say that f is a regular map from V to Vxe2x80xb2 if the range of f is contained in Vxe2x80xb2.The definition of the regular maps apply also to algebraic sets.The regular maps are also called morphisms, as they make the collection of all affine algebraic sets into a category, where the objects are the affine algebraic sets and the morphisms are the regular maps. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In five elections between 1973 and 1994 Austin voters rejected single-member districts.Austin is the county seat of Travis County and hosts the Heman Marion Sweatt Travis County Courthouse downtown, as well as other county government offices.The Texas Department of Transportation operates the Austin District Office in Austin.The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) operates the Austin I and Austin II district parole offices in Austin.The United States Postal Service operates several post offices in Austin.Austin is known as an enclave of liberal politics in an otherwise conservative statexe2x80x94so much so, that the city is sometimes sarcastically called the "People's Republic of Austin" by residents of other parts of Texas, and conservatives in the Texas Legislature.Since redistricting following the 2010 United States Census, Austin has been divided between six congressional districts at the federal level: Texas's 35th, Texas's 25th, Texas's 10th, Texas's 21st, Texas's 17th, and Texas's 31st.The pilot program tested two driverless bus models from EasyMile and Navya on a route from the Austin Convention Center to the Austin Central Library.The City of Austin is partnered with Austin B-Cycle, a nonprofit bike-sharing service with 63 stations in and around downtown for human-powered and electric bicycles.In 2018, scooter-sharing companies Lime and Bird debuted rentable electric scooters in Austin.Austin is also served by Electric Cab of North America's six-passenger electric cabs that operate on a flexible route from the Kramer MetroRail Station to Domain Northside and from the Downtown MetroRail station and MetroRapid stops to locations between the Austin Convention Center and near Sixth and Bowie streets by Whole Foods.The city also has access to carsharing services from Zipcar.Austin is known as the most bike-friendly city in Texas, and was ranked the #7 city in the US by Bicycling Magazine in 2016.The city's bike advocacy organization is Bike Austin.Bicycles are a popular transportation choice among students, faculty, and staff at the University of Texas.Austin also hosts the Out of Bounds Comedy Festival, which draws comedic artists in all disciplines to Austin.The Austin Public Library is a public library system operated by the City of Austin and consists of the Central Library on Cxc3xa9sar Chxc3xa1vez Street, the Austin History Center, 20 branches and the Recycled Reads bookstore and upcycling facility.The Central Library, which is an anchor to the redevelopment of the former Seaholm Power Plant site and the Shoal Creek Walk, opened on October 28, 2017.Museums in Austin include the Texas Memorial Museum, the George Washington Carver Museum and Cultural Center, Thinkery, the Blanton Museum of Art (reopened in 2006), the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum across the street (which opened in 2000), The Contemporary Austin, the Elisabet Ney Museum and the galleries at the Harry Ransom Center.KLRU produces several award-winning locally produced programs such as Austin City Limits.Alex Jones, journalist, radio show host and filmmaker, produces his talk show The Alex Jones Show in Austin which broadcasts nationally on more than 60 AM and FM radio stations in the United States, WWCR Radio shortwave and XM Radio: Channel 166.In 2009, 72.7% of Austin (city) commuters drove alone, with other mode shares being: 10.4% carpool, 6% work from home, 5% use transit, 2.3% walk, and 1% bicycle.In mid-2019, TomTom ranked Austin as having the worst traffic congestion in Texas, as well as 19th nationally and 179th globally.b'      DESCRIPTION: Capital of Texas, United States.{ }Austin (, ) It is the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States.As of the U.S. Census Bureau's July 1, 2019, estimate, Austin had a population of 978,908, Located in  within the greater Texas Hill Country, it is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways, including Lady Bird Lake and Lake Travis on the Colorado River, Barton Springs, McKinney Falls, and Lake Walter E. Long.Residents of Austin are known as Austinites.In 1987 Austin originated and remains the site for South by Southwest (stylized as SXSW and colloquially referred to as South By), an annual conglomeration of parallel film, interactive media, and music festivals and conferences that take place in mid-March.Emerging from a strong economic focus on government and education, since the 1990s Austin has become a center for technology and business.The Rainey Street district is also home to the Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center.Austin has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network under Media Arts the category."Old Austin" is an adage often used by the native citizens in Austin, Texas when being nostalgic to refer to the olden days of the capital city of Texas.The O. Henry House Museum hosts the annual O. Henry Pun-Off, a pun contest where the successful contestants exhibit wit akin to that of the author William Sydney Porter.Other annual events include Eeyore's Birthday Party, Spamarama, Austin Pride Festival & Parade in August, the Austin Reggae Festival in April, and Carnaval Brasileiro in February.Over time, the long-running television program Austin City Limits, its namesake Austin City Limits Festival, and the South by Southwest music festival solidified the city's place in the music industry.Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones Escarpment, on the Colorado River, with three artificial lakes within the city limits: Lady Bird Lake (formerly known as Town Lake), Lake Austin (both created by dams along the Colorado River), and Lake Walter E. Long that is partly used for cooling water for the Decker Power Plant.The team left after the 2015 season.In 2017, Precourt Sports Ventures announced a plan to move the Columbus Crew SC soccer franchise from Columbus, Ohio to Austin.The Austin Parks and Recreation Department received the Excellence in Aquatics award in 1999 and the Gold Medal Awards in 2004 from the National Recreation and Park Association.To strengthen the region's parks system, which spans more than , The Austin Parks Foundation (APF) was established in 1992 to develop and improve parks in and around Austin. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Archery, and the bow, play an important part in the epic poem the Odyssey, when Odysseus returns home in disguise and then bests the suitors in an archery competition after hinting at his identity by stringing and drawing his great bow that only he can draw, a similar motif is present in the Turkic heroic poem Alpamysh.In West African Yoruba belief, Osoosi is one of several deities of the hunt who are identified with bow and arrow iconography and other insignia associated with archery.While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern), all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string.b'      DESCRIPTION: Using a bow to shoot arrows.Archery is the art, sport, practice, or skill of using a bow to shoot arrows.The oldest known evidence of arrows comes from the South African site of Sibudu Cave, where the remains of bone and stone arrowheads  have been found dating approximately 60,000-70,000 years ago.Based on indirect evidence, the bow also seems to have appeared or reappeared later in Eurasia, near the transition from the Upper Paleolithic to the Mesolithic.In western archery, the arrow is usually released from the left hand side of the bow for a right-handed archer.Compound bows are designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In 1978 the Museum of Finnish Architecture in Helsinki arranged a major exhibition of Aalto's works.Although he is sometimes regarded as among the first and most influential architects of Nordic modernism, closer examination reveals that Aalto (while a pioneer in Finland) closely followed and had personal contacts with other pioneers in Sweden, in particular Gunnar Asplund It was a style that had been a reaction to the previous dominant style of National Romanticism before moving, in the late 1920s, towards Modernism.Upon returning to Jyvxc3xa4skylxc3xa4 in 1923 to establish his own architect's office, Aalto designed several single-family homes designed in the style of Nordic Classicism.Originally used in Baker House to signify the Ivy League university tradition, on his return to Finland Aalto used it in a number of key buildings, in particular, in several of the buildings in the new Helsinki University of Technology campus (starting in 1950), Sxc3xa4ynxc3xa4tsalo Town Hall (1952), Helsinki Pensions Institute (1954), Helsinki House of Culture (1958), as well as in his own summer house, the Experimental House in Muuratsalo (1957).In the 1950s Aalto immersed himself in sculpting: wood, bronze, marble or mixed media.Since the death of Elissa Aalto the office has continued to operate as the Alvar Aalto Academy, giving advice on the restoration of Aalto buildings and organising vast archive material. Whereas Aalto was famous for his architecture, his furniture designs were well thought of and are still popular today. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In BrE, the term marginal constituency is more often used for the same and swing is more commonly used to refer to how much one party has gained (or lost) an advantage over another compared to the previous election.tIn the UK, the term government only refers to what is commonly known in America as the executive branch or the particular administration.A local government in the UK is generically referred to as the "council," whereas in the United States a local government will be generically referred to as the "City" (or county, village, etc., depending on what kind of entity the government serves).In financial statements, what is referred to in AmE as revenue or sales is known in BrE as turnover.non-American) context, particularly in sports news outside English-speaking North America, American (or US branches of foreign) news agencies also use "football" to mean "soccer", especially in direct quotes.Similarly, the word "hockey" in BrE refers to field hockey and in AmE, "hockey" means ice hockey.Words with completely different meanings are relatively few; most of the time there are either (1) words with one or more shared meanings and one or more meanings unique to one variety (for example, bathroom and toilet) or (2) words the meanings of which are actually common to both BrE and AmE but that show differences in frequency, connotation or denotation (for example, smart, clever, mad).Some differences in usage and meaning can cause confusion or embarrassment.In AmE the word pissed means being annoyed whereas in BrE it is a coarse word for being drunk (in both varieties, pissed off means irritated).Similarly, in AmE the word pants is the common word for the BrE trousers and knickers refers to a variety of half-length trousers (though most AmE users would use the term "shorts" rather than knickers), while the majority of BrE speakers would understand pants to mean underpants and knickers to mean female underpants.Sometimes the confusion is more subtle.Student itself has a wider meaning in AmE, meaning any person of any age studying any subject at any level (including those not doing so at an educational institution, such as a "piano student" taking private lessons in a home), whereas in BrE it tends to be used for people studying at a post-secondary educational institution and the term pupil is more widely used for a young person at primary or secondary school, though the use of "student" for secondary school pupils in the UK is increasingly used, particularly for "sixth form" (years 12 and 13).tThe names of individual institutions can be confusing.In AmE each class is generally taught by a professor (although some US tertiary educational institutions follow the BrE usage), while the position of lecturer is occasionally given to individuals hired on a temporary basis to teach one or more classes and who may or may not have a doctoral degree.tThe word course in American use typically refers to the study of a restricted topic or individual subject (for example, "a course in Early Medieval England", "a course in integral calculus") over a limited period of time (such as a semester or term) and is equivalent to a module or sometimes unit at a British university.This can lead to some variations becoming extinct (for instance the wireless being progressively superseded by the radio) or the acceptance of wide variations as "perfectly good English" everywhere.Although spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are occasional differences which might cause embarrassmentxe2x80x94for example, in American English a rubber is usually interpreted as a condom rather than an eraser; and a British fanny refers to the female pubic area, while the American fanny refers to an ass (US) or an arse (UK).The familiarity of speakers with words and phrases from different regions varies, and the difficulty of discerning an unfamiliar definition also depends on the context and the term.In the US military the British forms are used, but the day is read cardinally, while among some speakers of New England and Southern American English varieties and who come from those regions but live elsewhere, those forms are common, even in formal contexts.t Phrases such as the following are common in the UK but are generally unknown in the US: "A week today", "a week tomorrow", "a week Tuesday" and "Tuesday week"; these all refer to a day more than a week in the future. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A read  returns the value stored in R and write(v) changes the value stored in R to v.A register is called atomic if it satisfies the two following properties:1) Each invocation op of a read or write operation:xe2x80xa2Must appear as if it were executed at a single point xcfx84(op) in time.xe2x80xa2xcfx84 (op) works as follow:xcfx84b(op) xe2x89xa4 xcfx84 (op) xe2x89xa4 xcfx84e(op): where xcfx84b(op) and xcfx84e(op) indicate the time when the operation op begins and ends.xe2x80xa2If op1 xe2x89xa0 op2, then xcfx84 (op1)xe2x89xa0xcfx84 (op2)2) Each read operation returns the value written by the last write operation before the read, in the sequence where all operations are ordered by their xcfx84 values.Atomic/Linearizable register:Termination: when a node is correct, sooner or later each read and write operation will complete.Safety Property (Linearization points for read and write and failed operations):Read operation:It appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.Write operation: Similar to read operation, it appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.Failed operation(The atomic term comes from this notion):It appears as if it is completed at every single node or it never happened at any node.Example : We know that an atomic register is one that is linearizable to a sequential safe register.The following picture shows where we should put the linearization point for each operation: An atomic register could be defined for a variable with a single writer but multi- readers (SWMR), single-writer/single-reader (SWSR), or multi-writer/multi-reader (MWMR). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He also criticises C. A. Mace's opinion He followed in the footsteps of Bertrand Russell by debating with the Jesuit scholar Frederick Copleston on the topic of religion.Ayer's version of emotivism divides "the ordinary system of ethics" into four classes:#"Propositions that express definitions of ethical terms, or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain definitions"#"Propositions describing the phenomena of moral experience, and their causes"#"Exhortations to moral virtue"#"Actual ethical judgments"He focuses on propositions of the first classxe2x80x94moral judgmentsxe2x80x94saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in normative ethics as opposed to meta-ethics) are too concrete for ethical philosophy.Ayer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with ethical intuitionists.b'      DESCRIPTION: English philosopher.{ }Sir Alfred Jules "Freddie" Ayer  (; usually cited as A.

<my-abstract> Only seven tragedies attributed to him have survived intact: The Persians, Seven Against Thebes, The Suppliants, the trilogy known as The Oresteia (the three tragedies Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers and The Eumenides), and Prometheus Bound (whose authorship is disputed).It is assumed, based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, scholia, and play fragments recorded by later authors, that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies: Seven Against Thebes was the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and The Suppliants and Prometheus Bound were each the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively."These are the remaining 71 plays ascribed to Aeschylus which are known to us:Orestes, main character in Aeschylus's only surviving trilogy The Oresteia]]The theatre was just beginning to evolve when Aeschylus started writing for it.The satyr play following this trilogy was titled Amymone, after one of the Danaids.Besides a few missing lines, the Oresteia of 458 BC is the only complete trilogy of Greek plays by any playwright still extant (of Proteus, the satyr play which followed, only fragments are known). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> There was little affection between her and the older children, but Anne, according to tradition, was her favourite.In Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte, Anne's father remembered her as precocious, reporting that once, when she was four years old, in reply to his question about what a child most wanted, she answered: "age and experience".In summer 1824, Patrick sent Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Emily to Crofton Hall in Crofton, West Yorkshire, and subsequently to the Clergy Daughter's School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire.Anne's studies at home included music and drawing.By July 1846, a package with the three manuscripts was making the rounds of London publishers.After a number of rejections, Emily's Wuthering Heights and Anne's Agnes Grey were accepted by the publisher Thomas Cautley Newby, but Charlotte's novel was rejected by every publisher to whom it was sent.Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, was published in the last week of June 1848.The following year he was appointed an examiner in Classics at Woodhouse Grove School, near Bradford a Wesleyan academy where, aged 35, he met his future wife, Maria Branwell, the headmaster's niece.Anne's mother, Maria Branwell (1783xe2x80x931821), was the daughter of Thomas Branwell, a successful, property-owning grocer and tea merchant in Penzance and Anne Carne, the daughter of a silversmith.Though from considerably different backgrounds, within three months Patrick Brontxc3xab and Maria Branwell were married on 29 December 1812. </my-abstract>

<lines> 140 </lines>
<my-abstract> As J. Brachtendorf showed, Augustine used Ciceronian Stoic concept of passions, to interpret Paul's doctrine of universal sin and redemption.The view that not only human soul but also senses were influenced by the fall of Adam and Eve was prevalent in Augustine's time among the Fathers of the Church.Some authors perceive Augustine's doctrine as directed against human sexuality and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from Augustine's need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the Confessions.}}Some Protestant theologians, such as Justo L. Gonzxc3xa1lez and Bengt Hxc3xa4gglund, interpret Augustine's teaching that grace is irresistible, results in conversion, and leads to perseverance.In On Rebuke and Grace (De correptione et gratia), Augustine wrote: "And what is written, that He wills all men to be saved, while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings of mine; but here I will say one thing: He wills all men to be saved, is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them.They include apologetic works against the heresies of the Arians, Donatists, Manichaeans and Pelagians; texts on Christian doctrine, notably De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine); exegetical works such as commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms and Paul's Letter to the Romans; many sermons and letters; and the Retractationes, a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life.Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his Confessions, which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for De civitate Dei (The City of God, consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410.Later, in response to Pelagius, Augustine said that the sin of pride consists in assuming "we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us", and argued that God's grace causes individual act of faith.Scholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies double predestination, or the belief God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation."Jean Bethke Elshtain in Augustine and the Limits of Politics tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: "Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing.In On Christian Doctrine Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God.Before the Fall, Augustine believed sex was a passionless affair, "just like many a laborious work accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat", After the Fall, by contrast, the penis cannot be controlled by mere will, subject instead to both unwanted impotence and involuntary erections: "Sometimes the urge arises unwanted; sometimes, on the other hand, it forsakes the eager lover, and desire grows cold in the body while burning in the mind...While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see total depravity).According to Leo Ruickbie, Augustine's arguments against magic, differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against paganism and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and witchcraft. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive (they do not actively interrogate the transponders of other aircraft) and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution.To help avoid controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), aircraft use systems such as ground-proximity warning systems (GPWS), which use radar altimeters as a key element.Modern displays allow weather information to be integrated with moving maps, terrain, and traffic onto a single screen, greatly simplifying navigation.Modern weather systems also include wind shear and turbulence detection and terrain and traffic warning systems.There has been a progression towards centralized control of the multiple complex systems fitted to aircraft, including engine monitoring and management. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> His value as a war god is placed in doubt: during the Trojan War, Ares was on the losing side, while Athena, often depicted in Greek art as holding Nike (Victory) in her hand, favoured the triumphant Greeks.Ares plays a relatively limited role in Greek mythology as represented in literary narratives, though his numerous love affairs and abundant offspring are often alluded to.The counterpart of Ares among the Roman gods is Mars, who as a father of the Roman people was given a more important and dignified place in ancient Roman religion as a guardian deity.Cadmus placed himself in the god's service for eight years atoning for the crime of killing Aresxe2x80x99 dragon.The Ludovisi Ares, Roman version of a Greek original c. 320 BC, with 17th-century restorations by [[Bernini]]In the tale sung by the bard in the hall of Alcinous, the Sun-god Helios once spied Ares and Aphrodite having sex secretly in the hall of Hephaestus, her husband.Essentially, it was a Roman temple to the Augustan Mars Ultor.Ares may also be accompanied by Kydoimos, the daemon of the din of battle; the Makhai ("Battles"); the "Hysminai" ("Acts of manslaughter"); Polemos, a minor spirit of war, or only an epithet of Ares, since it has no specific dominion; and Polemos's daughter, Alala, the goddess or personification of the Greek war-cry, whose name Ares uses as his own war-cry. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> As this tension is an integral part of AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a quasi-religious organization.US courts have not extended the status of privileged communication, such as that enjoyed by clergy and lawyers, to AA related communications between members.A study found an association between an increase in attendance to AA meetings with increased spirituality and a decrease in the frequency and intensity of alcohol use.After thirty days of working with Wilson, Smith drank his last drink on 10 June 1935, the date marked by AA for its anniversaries.The first female member Florence Rankin joined AA in March 1937,During the COVID-19 pandemic, many AA meetings moved to online meetings using platforms such as Zoom, Google Hangouts, and conference calls. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This alpha value also corresponds to the ratio of "SRC over DST" in Porter and Duff equations.The value of the resulting color is given by:begin{cases}mathrm{out}_A = mathrm{src}_A + mathrm{dst}_A (1 - mathrm{src}_A) mathrm{out}_text{RGB} = bigl( mathrm{src}_text{RGB} mathrm{src}_A + mathrm{dst}_text{RGB} mathrm{dst}_A left( 1 - mathrm{src}_A right) bigr) div mathrm{out}_A mathrm{out}_A = 0 Rightarrow mathrm{out}_text{RGB} = 0end{cases}If the destination background is opaque, then <math>text{dst}_A = 1</math>, and if you enter it to the upper equation:begin{cases}mathrm{out}_A = 1 mathrm{out}_text{RGB} = mathrm{src}_text{RGB} mathrm{src}_A + mathrm{dst}_text{RGB} (1 - mathrm{src}_A)end{cases}The alpha component may be used to blend to red, green and blue components equally, as in 32-bit RGBA, or, alternatively, there may be three alpha values specified corresponding to each of the primary colors for spectral color filtering.If premultiplied alpha is used, the above equations are simplified to:begin{cases}mathrm{out}_A = mathrm{src}_A + mathrm{dst}_A (1 - mathrm{src}_A) mathrm{out}_text{RGB} = mathrm{src}_text{RGB} + mathrm{dst}_text{RGB} left( 1 - mathrm{src}_A right)end{cases}Although used for similar purposes, transparent colors and image masks do not permit the smooth blending of the superimposed image pixels with those of the background (only whole image pixels or whole background pixels allowed).A similar effect can be achieved with a 1-bit alpha channel, as found in the 16-bit RGBA Highcolor mode of the Truevision TGA image file format and related TARGA and AT-Vista/NU-Vista display adapters' Highcolor graphic mode.By setting <math>X_0 = X_1</math> and <math>Y_0 = Y_1</math> we getbegin{align}  alpha_o &= 1 - (1 - alpha_a) (1 - alpha_b),[5pt]  C_o &= frac{alpha_a C_a + (1 - alpha_a)alpha_b C_b}{alpha_o},end{align}which means that we have analytically derived a formula for the output alpha and the output color of <math>a odot b</math>.An even more compact representation is given by noticing that <math>(1 - alpha_a)alpha_b = alpha_o - alpha_a</math>:  C_o = frac{alpha_a}{alpha_o} C_a + left(1 - frac{alpha_a}{alpha_o}right) C_bThe <math>odot</math> operator fulfills all the requirements of a non-commutative monoid, where the identity element <math>e</math> is chosen such that <math>e odot a = a odot e = a</math> (i.e.This mode devotes 5 bits for every primary RGB color (15-bit RGB) plus a remaining bit as the "alpha channel".The RGB values stored in computer images are actually not the real light intensities, but they have been transformed by a gamma correction, in order to optimize the usage of bits when encoding an image.The gamma correction can be roughly summarised as below:Then we have the following relation:Thus, when dealing with computer stored RGB values, alpha blending will look much better (and be more "correct", in a physical sense of additive light) if the gamma correction is unapplied before averaging the images and re-applied afterwards.For example, if one wants to superimpose an image named <math>overlay_text{rgb}</math> with an alpha channel <math>overlay_{alpha}</math> onto a background image <math>background_text{rgb}</math>, then the resulting image <math>out_text{rgb}</math> can be calculated like this:text{out}_text{rgb} = (text{overlay}_text{rgb}^gamma times text{overlay}_alpha + text{background}_text{rgb}^gamma times (1 - text{overlay}_alpha))^{1/gamma }Note: <math>text{out}_text{rgb}</math> is the image as it will be stored in the computer memory; and it will be displayed as <math>text{out}_text{rgb}^gamma</math> on the computer display.' </my-abstract>

<title>Array data structure</title>
<wiki-abstract> In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. </wiki-abstract>

<lines> 65 </lines>
<my-abstract> The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.For example, an array of 10 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i xc3x97 4).The memory address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base address.Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices.An index maps the array value to a stored object.There are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed:; 0 (zero-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 0., where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the address increment or stride.If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant B is simply the address of the first element of the array.For example, consider the matrix  begin{bmatrix}    1 & 2 & 3     4 & 5 & 6     7 & 8 & 9  end{bmatrix}.In the row-major order layout (adopted by C for statically declared arrays), the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row:In column-major order (traditionally used by Fortran), the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a column have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column:For arrays with three or more indices, "row major order" puts in consecutive positions any two elements whose index tuples differ only by one in the last index. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> "In joyful strains then let us singAdvance Australia fair.</poem>Behold us from afar,We'll rise to high renown and shineLike our glorious southern star;From England soil and Fatherland,Scotia and Erin fair,Let all combine with heart and handTo advance Australia fair.In joyful strains then let us singAdvance Australia fair.</poem>Or dare a foot to land,We'll rouse to arms like sires of yore,To guard our native strand;Britannia then shall surely know,Though oceans roll between,Her sons in fair Australia's landStill keep their courage green.In joyful strains then let us singAdvance Australia fair.</poem>The 1901 Federation version of the third verse was originally sung as:We'll toil with hearts and hands;To make our youthful Commonwealth,Renowned of all the lands;For loyal sons beyond the seasWe've boundless plains to share;With courage let us all combineTo advance Australia fair.In joyful strains then let us singAdvance Australia fair!</poem>The song has been criticised for failing to represent or acknowledge Australia's Indigenous peoples and the country's colonial history.It was commissioned by ABC Records in 1984 and then televised by Channel 10 in 1986 in their Australia Day broadcast, featuring Julie Anthony as the soloist.The lyrics of "Advance Australia Fair", as modified by the National Australia Day Council, which were officially adopted in April 1984, are as follows:For we are young and free;We've golden soil and wealth for toil;Our home is girt by sea;Our land abounds in nature's giftsOf beauty rich and rare;In history's page, let every stageAdvance Australia Fair.In joyful strains then let us sing,Advance Australia Fair.</poem>We'll toil with hearts and hands;To make this Commonwealth of oursRenowned of all the lands;For those who've come across the seasWe've boundless plains to share;With courage let us all combineTo Advance Australia Fair.In joyful strains then let us sing,Advance Australia Fair.</poem>Since the original lyrics were written in 1878, there have been several changes, in some cases with the intent of increasing the anthem's inclusiveness and gender neutrality.The first verse was kept largely as the 1878 original, except for the change in the first line from " let us rejoice" to " let us rejoice".The lyrics published in the second edition (1879) were as follows:For we are young and free;We've golden soil and wealth for toil,Our home is girt by sea;Our land abounds in Nature's giftsOf beauty rich and rare;In hist'ry's page, let ev'ry stageAdvance Australia fair.In joyful strains then let us sing,Advance Australia fair.</poem>To trace wide oceans o'er,True British courage bore him on,Til he landed on our shore.Then here he raised Old England's flag,The standard of the brave;"With all her faults we love her still""Britannia rules the wave.Conducted through the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the survey polled 60,000 people nationally.On 22 January 1976 the Fraser government reinstated "God Save the Queen" as the national anthem and should be used for royal, vice-regal, defence and loyal toast occasions."Advance Australia Fair", with modified lyrics and reduced to two verses (see development of lyrics), was adopted as the Australian national anthem on 19 April 1984 by a proclamation by the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen,The orchestral arrangement of "Advance Australia Fair" that is now regularly played for Australian victories at international sporting medal ceremonies, and at the openings of major domestic sporting, cultural and community events, is by Tommy Tycho, an immigrant from Hungary. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> As widespread inefficiencies in numbering (such as the assignment of entire blocks of 10000 numbers to every competing carrier in every small village to support local number portability schemes) have created shortages of available numbers, these prefixes are often "reclaimed" and issued as standard exchanges, moving the handful of numbers in them to one standard test exchange (usually 958).Some carriers have been known to disable payphone calls to 958 or 959 test lines, such as Bell Canada's system-wide ANAC line at (area code) 958-2580. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Feelings also ran high among earlier historians who felt that Vespucci lied about this voyage to gain primacy over Columbus as the first explorer to encounter the mainland.In 1499, Vespucci joined an expedition licensed by Spain and led by Alonso de Ojeda as fleet commander and Juan de la Cosa as chief navigator.Vespucci estimated their latitude at 32xc2xb0 S but experts now estimate they were closer to 25xc2xb0 S. Their homeward journey is unclear since Vespucci left a confusing record of astronomical observations and distances travelled.In 1503, Vespucci may have participated in a second expedition for the Portuguese crown, again exploring the east coast of Brazil. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Disc corruption could also occur if attempting to use the  command without disabling the blinking cursor with the following command:Speeding up the low portion of memory is particularly useful on 6502 derived machines because that processor has a faster addressing mode for the first 256 bytes and so it is common for software to put any variables involved in time critical sections of program into that region.The cost of the 64 Kbit SRAM chip would have been more than that of doubling the four 64 KBit DRAM chips to give 8-bit RAM access, fixing both the modest memory and poor performance issues of the Electron.A development of the Turbo Board, the Master RAM Board duplicated the Turbo Board functionality and added a further option of running the micro with 32& kB of static shadow RAM in addition to the ordinary 32& kB xe2x80x94  giving 64& kB total.While its speed was acceptable compared to the Commodore and competing computers the Electron was, however, much slower than the BBC Micro; Popular Computing Weekly reported, for example, that BBC Micro games ran "at less than half the speed, with very significant effects on their appeal".The reduced processor speed was attributable to the use of a 4 bit wide memory system instead of the 8 bit wide memory system of the BBC Micro to reduce cost.This consisted of a de-badged Electron plus a large expansion unit containing 32& kB of battery-backed RAM (making up 64& kB of RAM in total), 48& kB of ROM, a Centronics printer port, a modem, and the speech generator previously offered for the BBC Micro.The hardware of the BBC Micro was emulated by a single customized ULA chip designed by Acorn in conjunction with Ferranti. </my-abstract>

The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of "aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering" and "The profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics). </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Historically aviation meant only heavier-than-air flight, but nowadays it includes flying in balloons and airships.Aeronautical engineering covers the design and construction of aircraft, including how they are powered, how they are used and how they are controlled for safe operation.A major part of aeronautical engineering is aerodynamics, the science of passing through the air.With the increasing activity in space flight, nowadays aeronautics and astronautics are often combined as aerospace engineering.The science of aerodynamics deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.The study of aerodynamics falls broadly into three areas:Incompressible flow occurs where the air simply moves to avoid objects, typically at subsonic speeds below that of sound (Mach 1).Compressible flow occurs where shock waves appear at points where the air becomes compressed, typically at speeds above Mach 1.Transonic flow occurs in the intermediate speed range around Mach 1, where the airflow over an object may be locally subsonic at one point and locally supersonic at another.A rocket or rocket vehicle is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle which obtains thrust from a rocket engine.The term "aviation" is sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics, although "aeronautics" includes lighter-than-air craft such as airships, and includes ballistic vehicles while "aviation" technically does not.A significant part of aeronautical science is a branch of dynamics called aerodynamics, which deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.Attempts  to fly without any real aeronautical understanding have been made from the earliest times, typically by constructing wings and jumping from a tower with crippling or lethal results.Wiser investigators sought to gain some rational understanding through the study of bird flight. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He was educated, a man of means, probably urban, and someone who respected manual work, although not a worker himself; this is significant, because more high-brow writers of the time looked down on the artisans and small business people who made up the early church of Paul and were presumably Luke's audience.The earliest possible date for Luke-Acts is around 62 AD, the time of Paul's imprisonment in Rome, but most scholars date the work to 80xe2x80x9390 AD on the grounds that it uses Mark as a source, looks back on the destruction of Jerusalem, and does not show any awareness of the letters of Paul (which began circulating late in the first century); if it does show awareness of the Pauline epistles, and also of the work of the Jewish historian Josephus, as some believe, then a date in the early 2nd century is possible.There are two major textual variants of Acts, the Western text-type and the Alexandrian.Major turning points in the structure of Acts, for example, find parallels in Luke: the presentation of the child Jesus in the Temple parallels the opening of Acts in the Temple, Jesus's forty days of testing in the wilderness prior to his mission parallel the forty days prior to his Ascension in Acts, the mission of Jesus in Samaria and the Decapolis (the lands of the Samaritans and Gentiles) parallels the missions of the Apostles in Samaria and the Gentile lands, and so on (see Gospel of Luke). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> While there is no distinct pattern of the outcomes of aphasia based on severity alone, global aphasia typically makes functional language gains, but may be gradual since global aphasia affects many language areas.While aphasia has traditionally been described in terms of language deficits, there is increasing evidence that many people with aphasia commonly experience co-occurring non-linguistic cognitive deficits.Most acute cases of aphasia recover some or most skills by working with a speech-language pathologist.With each of these though, unlike some aphasias, functionality within daily life remains intact.Recent classification schemes adopting this approach, such as the Boston-Neoclassical Model, also group these classical aphasia subtypes into two larger classes: the nonfluent aphasias (which encompasses Broca's aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia) and the fluent aphasias (which encompasses Wernicke's aphasia, conduction aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> While Applesoft BASIC is slower than Integer BASIC, it has many features that the older BASIC lacks:Conversely, Applesoft lacks the <code>MOD</code> (remainder) operator that had been present in Integer BASIC.Adapting BASIC for the Apple II was a tedious job as Apple received a source listing for Microsoft 6502 BASIC which proved to be buggy and also required the addition of Integer BASIC commands.The Applesoft license also saved Microsoft from near-bankruptcy when they licensed BASIC to Commodore for the PET in an agreement that proved unexpectedly costly for them.Apple reportedly obtained an eight-year license for Applesoft BASIC from Microsoft for a flat fee of $31,000, renewing it in 1985 through an arrangement that gave Microsoft the rights and source code for Apple's Macintosh version of BASIC. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> For example, similar communication functions were included in a device called an interocitor in the 1952 novel This Island Earth by Raymond F. Jones, and the 1955 film based on that novel, and in the "Dirac Communicator", which first appeared in James Blish's short story "Beep" (1954), which was later expanded into the novel The Quincunx of Time (1973).. Robert Heinlein in Time for the Stars (1958) employed instantaneous telepathic communication between identical twin pairs over interstellar distances, and like Le Guin provided a technical explanation based on a non-Einsteinian principle of Simultaneity.In her subsequent works, Le Guin continued to develop the concept of the ansible:Any ansible may be used to communicate through any other, by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible. </my-abstract>

In 1988, IBM announced AIX/370, also developed by Locus Computing.  AIX/370 was IBM's fourth attempt to offer Unix-like functionality for their mainframe line, specifically the System/370 (the prior versions were a TSS/370-based Unix system developed jointly with AT&T c.1980, a VM/370-based system named VM/IX developed jointly with Interactive Systems Corporation c.1984, and a VM/370-based version of TSS/370 named IX/370 which was upgraded to be compatible with Unix System V).  AIX/370 was released in 1990 with functional equivalence to System V Release 2 and 4.3BSD as well as IBM enhancements.  With the introduction of the ESA/390 architecture, AIX/370 was replaced by AIX/ESA in 1991, which was based on OSF/1, and also ran on the System/390 platform.  This development effort was made partly to allow IBM to compete with Amdahl UTS.  Unlike AIX/370, AIX/ESA ran both natively as the host operating system, and as a guest under VM.  AIX/ESA, while technically advanced, had little commercial success, partially because UNIX functionality was added as an option to the existing mainframe operating system, MVS, which became MVS/ESA OpenEdition in 1999.

<my-abstract> Apple introduced the AppleTalk PC Card in early 1987, allowing PCs to join AppleTalk networks and print to LaserWriter printers.The "TOPS Teleconnector" MS-DOS networking system over AppleTalk system enabled MS-DOS PCs to communicate over AppleTalk network hardware; it comprised an AppleTalk interface card for the PC and a suite of networking software allowing such functions as file, drive and printer sharing.The Mac TOPS software did not match the quality of Apple's own either in ease of use or in robustness and freedom from crashes, but the DOS software was relatively simple to use in DOS terms, and was robust.The BSD and Linux operating systems support AppleTalk through an open source project called Netatalk, which implements the complete protocol suite and allows them to both act as native file or print servers for Macintosh computers, and print to LocalTalk printers over the network.The Windows Server operating systems supported AppleTalk starting with Windows NT and ending after Windows Server 2003.A zone was a subdivision of the network that made sense to humans (for example, "Accounting Department"); but while a network number had to be assigned to a topologically-contiguous section of the network, a zone could include several different discontiguous portions of the network.The initial default hardware implementation for AppleTalk was a high-speed serial protocol known as LocalTalk that used the Macintosh's built-in RS-422 ports at 230.4 kbit/s.The AppleTalk address resolution protocol (AARP) allowed AppleTalk hosts to automatically generate their own network addresses, and the Name Binding Protocol (NBP) was a dynamic system for mapping network addresses to user-readable names. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The company was able to raise monthly sales to 5,000, but the IBM PC's successful launch encouraged software companies to develop for it instead, causing Apple to shift focus to the Lisa and Macintosh.The file system and some design ideas from Apple SOS, the Apple III's operating system, were part of Apple ProDOS and Apple GS/OS, the major operating systems for the Apple II series following the demise of the Apple III, as well as the Apple Lisa, which was the de facto business-oriented successor to the Apple III. </my-abstract>

// Inner child of Z    // Y is by 1 higher than sibling    t3 = right_child(Y);    left_child(Z) = t3;    if (t3 != null)        parent(t3) = Z;    right_child(Y) = Z;    parent(Z) = Y;    t2 = left_child(Y);

   }    return Z; // return new root of rotated subtree}Figure 5 shows a Right Left situation.If the above procedure is applied to nodes along this path, starting from the leaf, then every node in the tree will again have a balance factor of xe2x88x921, 0, or 1.The retracing can stop if the balance factor becomes 0 implying that the height of that subtree remains unchanged.If the balance factor becomes xc2xb11 then the height of the subtree increases by one and the retracing needs to continue.If the balance factor temporarily becomes xc2xb12, this has to be repaired by an appropriate rotation after which the subtree has the same height as before (and its root the balance factor 0).The time required is  for lookup, plus a maximum of  retracing levels ( on average) on the way back to the root, so the operation can be completed in  time.The preliminary steps for deleting a node are described in section Binary search tree#Deletion.There, the effective deletion of the subject node or the replacement node decreases the height of the corresponding child tree either from 1 to 0 or from 2 to 1, if that node had a child.Starting at this subtree, it is necessary to check each of the ancestors for consistency with the invariants of AVL trees.Node(l,k,r) means to create a node of left child <math>l</math>, key <math>k</math>, and right child <math>r</math>. function split(T,k)     if (T=nil) return (nil,false,nil)     (L,m,R)=expose(T)     if (k=m) return (L,true,R)     if (k<m)         (L',b,R')=split(L,k)        return (L',b,join(R',m,R))     if (k>m)         (L',b,R')=split(R,k)        return (join(L,m,L'),b,R'))The union of two AVLs  and  representing sets  and , is an AVL  that represents . function union(t):     if t = nil:         return t     if t = nil:         return t     t.root     return join(t))Here, Split is presumed to return two trees: one holding the keys less its input key, one holding the greater keys.With the new operations, the implementation of AVL trees can be more efficient and highly-parallelizable. function joinRightAVL(T)     (l,k',c)=expose(T)     if (h(c)<=h(T)+1)        T'=Node(c,k,T)        if (h(T')<=h(l)+1) then return Node(l,k',T')        else return rotateLeft(Node(l,k'rotateRight(T')))     else          T'=joinRightAVL(c,k,T)         T=Node(l,k',T')         if (h(T')<=h(l)+1) return T         else return rotateLeft(T) function joinLeftAVL(T)   /* symmetric to joinRightAVL */ function join(T)     if (h(T)     if (h(T)     return Node(T)     Here <math>h(v)</math> of a node <math>v</math> the height of <math>v</math>.<math>|N|</math> is the number of nodes below the tree with <math>N</math> as root (including the root) and <math>N_l</math> is the left child node of <math>N</math>.</ref> that is, sibling nodes can have hugely differing numbers of descendants.In a binary tree the balance factor of a <math>node</math> is defined to be the height differenceof its two child sub-trees. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims to divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The thirteenth century astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote a textbook, the Liber Astronomicus, a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned at the end of the fifteenth century.In Paradiso, the final part of the Divine Comedy, the Italian poet Dante Alighieri referred "in countless details"In the seventh century, Isidore of Seville argued in his Etymologiae that astronomy described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing the movements of the sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous.In the late 1400s, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola forcefully attacked astrology in Disputationes contra Astrologos, arguing that the heavens neither caused, nor heralded earthly events.Ephemerides with complex astrological calculations, and almanacs interpreting celestial events for use in medicine and for choosing times to plant crops, were popular in Elizabethan England.English astrology had reached its zenith by the 17th century.During the Enlightenment, intellectual sympathy for astrology fell away, leaving only a popular following supported by cheap almanacs.Advocates have defined astrology as a symbolic language, an art form, a science, and a method of divination.These include Hindu astrology (also known as "Indian astrology" and in modern times referred to as "Vedic astrology") and Chinese astrology, both of which have influenced the world's cultural history.Western astrology is a form of divination based on the construction of a horoscope for an exact moment, such as a person's birth.Western astrology is founded on the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through signs of the zodiac (twelve spatial divisions of the ecliptic) and by their aspects (based on geometric angles) relative to one another.Why is it that you have given an influence to al-Ra's and al-Dhanab, which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?Maimonides, the preeminent Jewish philosopher, astronomer, and legal codifier, wrote that astrology is forbidden by Jewish law.The Catechism of the Catholic Church maintains that divination, including predictive astrology, is incompatible with modern Catholic beliefsConfirmation bias is a form of cognitive bias, a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology.Under the criterion of falsifiability, first proposed by the philosopher of science Karl Popper, astrology is a pseudoscience.In contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical.Tanya Luhrmann has said that "all magicians know something about astrology," and refers to a table of correspondences in Starhawk's The Spiral Dance, organised by planet, as an example of the astrological lore studied by magicians.Hindu natal astrology originated with Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE,Chinese astrology has a close relation with Chinese philosophy (theory of the three harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as yin and yang, the Five phases, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 Earthly Branches, and shichen (xe6x99x82xe8xbexb0 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes). </my-abstract>

<lines> 22 </lines>
<my-abstract> Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice.An extension L/K is algebraic if and only if every sub K-algebra of L is a field.The class of algebraic extensions forms a distinguished class of field extensions, that is, the following three properties hold:# If E is an algebraic extension of F and F is an algebraic extension of K then E is an algebraic extension of K.# If E and F are algebraic extensions of K in a common overfield C, then the compositum EF is an algebraic extension of K.# If E is an algebraic extension of F and E>K>F then E is an algebraic extension of K.These finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction:  This fact, together with Zorn's lemma (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of algebraic closures.Model theory generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of M into N is called an algebraic extension if for every x in N there is a formula p with parameters in M, such that p(x) is true and the setis finite. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> Aesthetics, or esthetics (), is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature  of  beauty and taste, as well as the philosophy of art (its own area of philosophy that comes out of aesthetics). It examines subjective and sensori-emotional values, or sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> In practice, aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily an art object), while artistic judgement refers to the recognition, appreciation or criticism of art or an art work.Philosophical aesthetics not only has to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works, but also has to give a definition of what art is.Osborne noted that [http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf contemporary art is 'post-conceptual'] in a public lecture delivered in 2010.Gary Tedman has put forward a theory of a subjectless aesthetics derived from Karl Marx's concept of alienation, and Louis Althusser's antihumanism, using elements of Freud's group psychology, defining a concept of the 'aesthetic level of practice'.Gregory Loewen has suggested that the subject is key in the interaction with the aesthetic object. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Biblical Ark of the Covenant is approximately  long,  wide, and  high in the shape of a rectangular chest.Lundquist observes that the Anubis Shrine is not strictly analogous to the Ark of the Covenant; it can only be said that it is "ark-like", constructed of wood,  gessoed and gilded, stored within a sacred tomb, "guarding" the treasury of the tomb (and not the primary focus of that environment), that it contains compartments within it that store and hold sacred objects, that it has a figure of Anubis on its lid, and that it was carried by two staves permanently inserted into rings at its base and borne by eight priests in the funerary procession to Tutankhamun's tomb.Philip Kaufman conceived of the Ark of the Covenant as the main plot device of Steven Spielberg's 1981 adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark,In the Danish family film The Lost Treasure of the Knights Templar from 2006, the main part of the treasure found in the end is the Ark of the Covenant.Additionally, 2 Chronicles 35:3Thomas Rxc3xb6mer also suggests that the ark may have originally carried sacred stones "of the kind found in the chests of pre-Islamic Bedouins", and speculates that these may have been either a statue of Yahweh or a pair of statues depicting both Yahweh and his companion goddess Asherah.The Ark is first mentioned in the Book of Exodus, and then numerous times in Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, I Samuel, II Samuel, I Kings, I Chronicles, II Chronicles, Psalms and Jeremiah.In the Book of Jeremiah, it is referenced by Jeremiah, who, speaking in the days of Josiah, prophesied a future time, possibly the end of days, when the Ark will no longer be talked about or be made again:Rashi comments on this verse that "The entire people will be so imbued with the spirit of sanctity that God's Presence will rest upon them collectively, as if the congregation itself was the Ark of the Covenant.According to the Book of Exodus, God instructed Moses on Mount Sinai during his 40-day stay upon the mountain where God wasIn the Battle of Jericho, the Ark was carried round the city once a day for six days, preceded by the armed men and seven priests sounding seven trumpets of rams' horns.According to the Biblical narrative, a few years later the elders of Israel decided to take the Ark out onto the battlefield to assist them against the Philistines, after being defeated at the battle of Eben-Ezer.The Philistines took the Ark to several places in their country, and at each place misfortune befell them.After the Ark had been among them for seven months, the Philistines, on the advice of their diviners, returned it to the Israelites, accompanying its return with an offering consisting of golden images of the tumors and mice wherewith they had been afflicted. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> About a thousand of such systems were sold for many hundreds of Dutch schools.Because of cash flow problems (resulting from growing too fast, insufficient financial backing, technical problems, and a sudden problem with Z80 processor deliveries) the company suddenly folded even before it came to full fruition.Perhaps the Aster computer inspired another Dutch computer firm to name their computer after another typical Dutch flower&mdash;the Tulip's Tulip System-1 which appeared about the same time Aster folded.Most of the engineers who designed the hardware and software of the Aster went on to design hardware and software for the (then new) MSX system for a company called "Micro Technology b.v.".To enhance and modernize the Aster CT-80 the company also designed three alternative video display adapters to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster it was simply a matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system).A hard disk interface was also in the works, which would, add a SCSI interface, and the necessary software. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Manfred ruled that the Braves must forfeit 13 international prospects, including highly touted Kevin Maitan, an infielder from Venezuela who signed for $4.25& million in 2016.Additionally, the Braves shall be prohibited from signing any international player for more than $10,000 during the 2019xe2x80x9320 signing period and their international signing bonus pool for the 2020xe2x80x9321 signing period will be reduced by 50%.Atlanta Braves do not have much expertise when it comes to series clinching games in playoffs during Common Era as a major league baseball team.Over its 138 seasons, the Braves franchise has won a total of three World Series Championships, one in each of the three cities they have played in.The Bravesxe2x80x93Mets rivalry is a rivalry between the two teams, featuring the Braves and the New York Mets as they both play in the National League East.Although their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the 1969 NLCS, en route to their first World Series championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1994 season when division realignment put both the Mets and the Braves in the NL East division.One memorable game the Braves played that year came on September 21, when they played rival New York Mets in the first major professional sporting event held in New York City since 9/11.In 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won the Eastern division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, and Houston Astros.Six National League Cy Young Awards in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers:In 2005, the Braves won the Division championship for the 14th consecutive time from 1991 to 2005.During the offseason the Braves signed few of their young talents to multi year contracts; Craig Kimbrel (4 years/$42& million), Freddie Freeman (8 years/$135M), Kris Medlen (1 year/$5.8M), Jason Heyward (2 years/$13.3M), Julio Teherxc3xa1n (6 years/$32.4M) and Andrelton Simmons (7 years/$58M).The Braves finished the season in a distant second place with a 79xe2x80x9383 record, which was their first losing season since 2008 and only their third since 1990.Prior to the 2015 season, the Braves fired general manager Frank Wren, and John Hart replaced him as interim general manager, choosing to only take the title of President of Baseball Operations.The Braves finished the season 68xe2x80x9393 and in last place in NL East.During the 2016 offseason, the Braves signed pitchers R.A. DickeyOn October 2, 2017, John Coppolella resigned as general manager of the Braves amid a Major League Baseball investigation into Atlanta's international signings, having committed what the Braves termed "a breach of MLB rules regarding the international player market".The Braves clinched the 18th division title in team history on September 22, 2013 after a Nationals loss to the Marlins in the first game of a double header; the Braves also won their game that day, beating the Chicago Cubs 5xe2x80x932 at Wrigley Field.After clinching the division title, they lost to the Dodgers 3xe2x80x931 in the Division Series.On November 11, 2013, the Braves announced that they would vacate Turner Field for a new stadium in Cobb County, in the northwest suburbs outside of Atlanta in 2017.On August 22, 2010 against the Chicago Cubs, Mike Minor struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record.On October 13, 2010, the Braves announced that Fredi Gonzxc3xa1lez would replace long-time Braves manager Bobby Cox as manager of the team in 2011.Players from the Braves' farm system, such as Freddie Freeman and Brandon Beachy, played regularly with the big league club, while Julio Teherxc3xa1n, Randall Delgado, and Mike Minor were called up for spot starts.On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself manager, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2xe2x80x931 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Thanks to its built-in MIDI ports, the ST enjoyed success for running music sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among amateurs and well-known musicians alike.The ST was superseded by the Atari STE, Atari TT, Atari MEGA STE, and Falcon computers.The Atari ST was born from the rivalry between home computer makers Atari, Inc. and Commodore International.Jay Miner, one of the original designers for the custom chips found in the Atari 2600 and Atari 8-bit family, tried to convince Atari management to create a new chipset for a video game console and computer.Because the early 520ST's were sold with TOS on disk, but this used up 192& KB or RAM so the machine only had around 256KB left.; 520ST<sup>M</sup>: a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output and 512& KB RAM.; 520ST<sup>FM</sup>: a 520STM with a newly redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive (in some cases a single sided drive only), and 512& KB RAM.; 1040ST<sup>F</sup>: a 520STFM with 1& MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive, but without RF modulator; 1040ST<sup>FM</sup>: a 520STFM with 1& MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive with RF modulator; Mega ST (MEGA 1, MEGA 2, MEGA 4): redesigned motherboard with 1, 2 or 4& MB of RAM, respectively, in a much improved "pizza box" case with a detached keyboard.GVox bought out Passport, and continues the program for Windows and macOS along with the other Passport product, the notation program Encore, which is as of 2013 marketed and maintained by a new iteration, Passport Music Software, LLC.Also popular on the ST was professional desktop publishing software, such as PageStream and Calamus; office tools such as word processors (WordPerfect, Microsoft Write, AtariWorks, WordWriter ST, First Word <small>[shipped with the machine]</small> and its Plus continuation, and others); spreadsheets (3D-Calc, LDW Power, LDW Power 2, LOGiSTiX Senior, PowerLedger ST, SwiftCalc ST, VIP Professional, and others); turnkey programs (Mail-Pro, Sales-Pro 6, Video-Pro, and others); database programs (A-Calc Prime, Data Manager, Data Manager Professional, DBMan V, Base Two, H&DBase, Informer II, DB Master One, SBT Database Accounting Library (dLedger, dInvoice, dOrder, dPurchases, and dPayables), Superbase Personal, Superbase Professional, Tracker ST, Zoomracks and others); and various CAD and CAM tools from amateur hobbyist to professional grade (Campus CAD, DynaCADD, Leonard ST, Technobox CAD/2...): all being largely targeted at, or even limited to owners of high-resolution monochrome monitors.Graphics programs such as NEOchrome, Degas & Degas Elite, Canvas, Deluxe Paint, and Cyber Paint (which author Jim Kent would later evolve into Autodesk Animator) featured advanced features such as 3D design and animation.The MEGA 1 mainboards had a redesigned memory chip area and could not be upgraded in this way as there are only places for the 1& MByte DRAM chips.; 520ST<sup>E</sup> and 1040ST<sup>E</sup>: a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound, a BLiTTER chip, and a 4096-color palette, in the older 1040-style all-in-one case; Mega STE: same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16& MHz processor with 16K cache, an onboard SCSI controller, additional faster RS232 port, VME expansion port, in an ST gray version of the TT case; STacy: a portable (but definitely not laptop) version of the ST with the complete ST keyboard, an LCD screen simulating 640x400 hi-res, and a mini-trakball intended mostly for travellers and musicians because of the backlit screen and its built-in midi ports.Another popular and powerful ST music sequencer application, Dr. T's KCS, contains a "Multi-Program Environment" that allows ST users to run other applications, such as the synthesizer patch editing software XoR (now known as Unisyn on the Macintosh), from within the sequencer application.Music tracker software was popular on the ST, such as the TCB Tracker, aiding the production of quality music from the Yamaha synthesizer ('chiptunes').An innovative music composition program that combines the sample playing abilities of a tracker with conventional music notation (which was usually only found in MIDI software) is called Quartet (after its four-note polyphonic tracker, which displays one monophonic stave at a time on color screens).Due to the ST having comparatively large amounts of memory for the time, sound sampling packages became a realistic proposition.Neither Atari nor Commodore was able to persuade large chains like ComputerLand or BusinessLand to sell their products,Although the more than 30 companies exhibiting ST software at Las Vegas COMDEX in November 1985xe2x80x94while the Amiga had almost nonexe2x80x94surprised the industry, The New York Times reported after Atlanta COMDEX that "more than 100 software titles will be available for the [ST], most written by small software houses that desperately need work",Trip Hawkins of Electronic Arts said "I don't think Atari understands the software business. </my-abstract>

<title>Armour</title>
<wiki-abstract> Armour (British English) or armor (American English; see  spelling differences) is a protective covering that is used to prevent damage from being inflicted to an object, individual or vehicle by direct contact weapons or projectiles, usually during combat, or from damage caused by a potentially dangerous environment or activity (e.g. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Such fire barriers may be designed to inherently function as armour, or may be  passive fire protection materials augmented by armour, where care must be taken to ensure that the armour's reaction to fire does not cause issues with regards to the fire barrier being armoured to defeat explosions and projectiles in addition to fire, especially since both functions must be provided simultaneously, meaning they must be fire-tested together to provide realistic evidence of fitness for purpose.Combat drones use little to no vehicular armour as they are not manned vessels, this results in them being lightweight and small in size.A 16th-century knight with a horse in full bardingBarding (also spelled bard or barb) is body armour for war horses, especially as used by European knights.During the late Middle Ages as armour protection for knights became more effective, their mounts became targets.Examples of armies equipping their troops in this fashion were the Aztecs (13th to 15th century CE).In East Asia many types of armour were commonly used at different times by various cultures, including scale armour, lamellar armour, laminar armour, plated mail, mail, plate armour and brigandine.At times the development of armour has paralleled the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armourers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility.Well-known armour types in European history include the lorica hamata, lorica squamata, and the lorica segmentata of the Roman legions, the mail hauberk of the early medieval age, and the full steel plate harness worn by later medieval and renaissance knights, and breast and back plates worn by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914xe2x80x9315). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Since World War II, main battle tanks have largely replaced gun-armed tank destroyers; although lightly armoured anti tank guided missile (ATGM) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank engagements.In post-Cold War conflict, the resurgence of expeditionary warfare has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles, sometimes called "protected gun systems", which may bear a superficial resemblance to tank destroyers, but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low intensity operations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.It is also lighter and can be taken to places that self-propelled guns cannot reach, so despite the advantages of the self-propelled artillery, towed guns remain in the arsenals of many modern armies.An assault gun is a gun or howitzer mounted on a motor vehicle or armoured chassis, designed for use in the direct fire role in support of infantry when attacking other infantry or fortified positions.Historically, the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed casemate on a tank chassis.ARVs are usually built on the basis of a vehicle in the same class as they are supposed to recover; a tank-based ARV is used to recover tanks, while an APC-based one recovers APCs, but does not have the power to tow a much heavier tank.An armoured vehicle-launched bridge (AVLB) is a combat support vehicle, sometimes regarded as a subtype of combat engineering vehicle, designed to assist militaries in rapidly deploying tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles across rivers.In the Battle of Amiens, 8 August 1918, the British Mk V* (Mark Five Star) tank carried a small number of machine gunners as an experiment, but the men were debilitated by the conditions inside the vehicle.An infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), also known as a mechanized infantry combat vehicle (MICV), is a type of armoured fighting vehicle used to carry infantry into battle and provide direct fire support.There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or mine ploughs, a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes, or lifting booms.Although the term "armoured engineer vehicle" is used specifically to describe these multi-purpose tank-based engineering vehicles, that term is also used more generically in British and Commonwealth militaries to describe all heavy tank-based engineering vehicles used in the support of mechanized forces.Some tanks have bulldozer blades while retaining their armament, but this does not make them armored bulldozers as such, because combat remains the primary role xe2x80x93 earth moving is a secondary task.An armoured recovery vehicle (ARV) is a type of vehicle recovery armoured fighting vehicle used to repair battle- or mine-damaged as well as broken-down armoured vehicles during combat, or to tow them out of the danger zone for more extensive repairs.By World War II, armies had large numbers of AFVs, together with other vehicles to carry troops this permitted highly mobile manoeuvre warfare.The concept of a highly mobile and protected fighting unit has been around for centuries; from Hannibal's war elephants to Leonardo's contraptions, military strategists endeavoured to maximize the mobility and survivability of their soldiers.Armoured fighting vehicles were not possible until internal combustion engines of sufficient power became available at the start of the 20th century.Modern armoured fighting vehicles represent the realization of an ancient concept - that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower.The up-armoured M1114 Humvee variant can be seen as an adaptation of the unarmoured Humvee to serve in the IMV role.File:CV9035 assessment (cropped).jpg|A CV-9035 Swedish infantry fighting vehicle used by U.S. Army.File:M113IraqiFreedom.jpg|The M113, one of the most common tracked APCs, on duty during the Iraq WarFile:Dingo 2.jpg|The ATF Dingo of the German Army is a mine-resistant/ambush protected infantry mobility vehicle used by several European armed forcesFile:278th MP Company's new ASVs.jpg|United States Army National Guard M1117 Armored Security VehiclesFile:Nexter Aravis, place Jeanne Helbling, Strasbourg 2010 (2).jpg|A French Nexter Aravis in Strasbourg.File:Norwegian Iveco LMV 02.jpg|Norwegian soldiers running operations in an Iveco LMV in Faryab province, Afghanistan. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power, All Quiet on the Western Front became one of the first degenerate books to be publicly burnt;A fellow patient of Remarque's in the military hospital in Duisburg objected to the negative depictions of the nuns and patients, and of the general portrayal of soldiers: xe2x80x9cThere were soldiers to whom the protection of homeland, protection of house and homestead, protection of family were the highest objective, and to whom this will to protect their homeland gave the strength to endure any extremities.xe2x80x9dThese criticisms suggest that perhaps experiences of the war and the personal reactions of individual soldiers to their experiences may be more diverse than Remarque portrays them; however, it is beyond question that Remarque gives voice to a side of the war and its experience that was overlooked or suppressed at the time.The song is a sorrowful rendition of the novel's story ("It's gone all quiet on the Western Front / Male Angels sigh / ghosts in a flooded trench / As Germany dies").Bob Dylan, during his Nobel Laureate lecture, cited this book as one that had a profound effect on his songwriting.On November 9, 2008, a radio adaptation of the novel was broadcast on BBC Radio 3, starring Robert Lonsdale as Paul Bxc3xa4umer and Shannon Graney as Katczinsky.Although publishers had worried that interest in World War I had waned more than 10 years after the armistice, Remarque's realistic depiction of trench warfare from the perspective of young soldiers struck a chord with the war's survivorsxe2x80x94soldiers and civilians alikexe2x80x94and provoked strong reactions, both positive and negative, around the world.With All Quiet on the Western Front, Remarque emerged as an eloquent spokesman for a generation that had been, in his own words, "destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells." </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> His critic and rival W. E. B. DuBois also commended business as a vehicle for African-American advancement.Forty percent of prison inmates are African-American.Although in the last decade black youth have had lower rates of cannabis (marijuana) consumption than whites of the same age, they have disproportionately higher arrest rates than whites: in 2010, for example, blacks were 3.73 times as likely to get arrested for using cannabis than whites, despite not significantly more frequently being users.After over 50 years, marriage rates for all Americans began to decline while divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births have climbed.In 2008, Democrats overwhelmingly voted 70% against California Proposition 8, African Americans voted 58% in favor of it while 42% voted against Proposition 8.Polls in North Carolina,Black Americans hold far more conservative opinions on abortion, extramarital sex, and raising children out of wedlock than Democrats as a whole.The gains made by African Americans in the civil rights movement and in the Black Power movement not only obtained certain rights for African Americans, but changed American society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways.According to DNA analysis led in 2006 by Penn State geneticist Mark D. Shriver, around 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent to one European great-grandparent and his/her forebears), 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent to one European grandparent and his/her forebears), and 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent to one European parent and his/her forebears).According to an mtDNA study by Salas et al.After the founding of the United States, most black people continued to be enslaved, concentrated in the Southern United States, with four million enslaved only liberated during and at the end Civil War in 1865.The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were people from Central and West Africa, who had been sold by other West Africans, or by half-European "merchant princes"The first African slaves arrived via Santo Domingo to the San Miguel de Gualdape colony (most likely located in the Winyah Bay area of present-day South Carolina), founded by Spanish explorer Lucas Vxc3xa1zquez de Ayllxc3xb3n in 1526.The first recorded Africans in British North America (including most of the future United States) were "20 and odd negroes" who came to Jamestown, Virginia via Cape Comfort in August 1619 as indentured servants.Africans could legally raise crops and cattle to purchase their freedom.By the 1640s and 1650s, several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own.b'      DESCRIPTION: Racial or ethnic group in the United States with African ancestry.{ }African Americans (also referred to as Black Americans or Afro-Americans)African Americans constitute the third largest ethnic group and the second largest racial group in the US, after White Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans.African-American history in the 16th century, included peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as slaves to Latin America and the Caribbean, and in the 17th century with slaves taken from Caribbean and later from Africa to British colonies in eastern North America.The movement resulted in the removal of codified, de jure racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law, and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society, including the Free Speech Movement, the disabled, the women's movement, Native Americans, and migrant workers.Some activists and academics contend that American news media coverage of African-American news, concerns, or dilemmas is inadequate,To combat this, Robert L. Johnson founded Black Entertainment Television, a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States.Consequently, the 365 African Americans in their sample have a genome-wide average of 78.1% West African ancestry and 18.5% European ancestry, with large variation among individuals (ranging from 99% to 1% West African ancestry). </my-abstract>

<title>Alford plea</title>
<wiki-abstract> An Alford plea (also called a Kennedy plea in West Virginia, an Alford guilty plea and the Alford doctrine), in United States law, is a guilty plea in criminal court, whereby a defendant in a criminal case does not admit to the criminal act and asserts innocence. In entering an Alford plea, the defendant admits that the evidence presented by the prosecution would be likely to persuade a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Court held that a ruling that the plea was entered into voluntarily is implied by the act of sentencing.In the 2006 case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Ballard v. Burton, Judge Carl E. Stewart writing for the Court held that an Alford guilty plea is a "variation of an ordinary guilty plea".In March 2009, the Minnesota House of Representatives characterized the Alford plea as: "a form of a guilty plea in which the defendant asserts innocence but acknowledges on the record that the prosecutor could present enough evidence to prove guilt. </my-abstract>

<title>Anti-realism</title>
<wiki-abstract> In analytic philosophy, anti-realism is an epistemological position first articulated by British philosopher Michael Dummett. The term was coined as an argument against a form of realism Dummett saw as 'colorless reductionism'. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Similarly, intuitionists object to the existence property for classical logic, where one can prove <math>exists x.phi(x)</math>, without being able to produce any term <math>t</math> of which <math>phi</math> holds.Dummett argues that this notion of truth lies at the bottom of various classical forms of anti-realism, and uses it to re-interpret phenomenalism, claiming that it need not take the form of reductionism.Dummett's writings on anti-realism draw heavily on the later writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein, concerning meaning and rule following, and can be seen as an attempt to integrate central ideas from the Philosophical Investigations into the constructive tradition of analytic philosophy deriving from Gottlob Frege.In philosophy of science, anti-realism applies chiefly to claims about the non-reality of "unobservable" entities such as electrons or genes, which are not detectable with human senses.One prominent variety of scientific anti-realism is instrumentalism, which takes a purely agnostic view towards the existence of unobservable entities, in which the unobservable entity X serves as an instrument to aid in the success of theory Y and does not require proof for the existence or non-existence of X.Some scientific anti-realists, however, deny that unobservables exist, even as non-truth conditioned instruments.In the philosophy of ethics, moral anti-realism (or moral irrealism) is a meta-ethical doctrine that there are no objective moral values or normative facts. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Baltimore has become the crossroads between North and South, a distinction it has held since the end of the Civil War.A global power city, Its restaurants compete fiercely for good reviews in the Food and Dining section of The New York Times, online guides, and Zagat's, the last of which is widely considered the premier American dining guide, published yearly and headquartered in New York.Many of the more complicated dishes with rich ingredients like Lobster Newberg, waldorf salad, vichyssoise, eggs benedict, and the New York strip steak were born out of a need to entertain and impress the well to do in expensive bygone restaurants like Delmonico's and still standing establishments like the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.Since the first reference to an alcoholic mixed drink called a cocktail comes from New York State in 1803, it is thus not a surprise that there have been many cocktails invented in New York and the surrounding environs.Pineapples have been an island staple since the 19th century and figure into many marinades and drinks.File:BBQ Food.jpg|Chicken, pork and corn cooking in a barbecue smokerFile: New_York-Style_Pizza.png|New Yorkxe2x80x93style pizza served at a pizzeria in New York File:Giordanos stuffed pizza.jpg|Chicago-style deep-dish pizza from the original Giordano's locationFile:Whiz wit' Pat.gif|A Philly cheesesteak from Patxe2x80x99s King of Steaks in PhiladelphiaFile:Keylimepiecut.jpg|Key lime pie is from Key West, FloridaFile:Ribs in a barbecue "pit".jpg|Memphis-style barbecueThe influence of ethnicity-specific cuisines like Italian cuisine and Mexican cuisine was present in the United States by World War I.Their native cuisine had less of an emphasis on meat, as evidenced by dishes they introduced like pasta e fagioli and minestrone, but the dishes they created in America often piled it on as a sign of wealth and newfound prosperity since for the first time even cheap cuts of it were affordable: the American recipe for lasagna is proof of this, as mostly it is derived from the Neapolitan version of the dish with large amounts of meat and cheese.New Yorkxe2x80x93style hot dogs came about with German speaking emigrants from Austria and Germany, particularly with the frankfurter sausage and the smaller wiener sausage; Jews would also contribute here by introducing the kosher version of these sausages, made of beef rather than pork.A summertime treat, Italian ice, began its life as a sweeter adaptation of the Sicilain granita that was strictly lemon flavored and brought to New York and Philadelphia.It has AVA's near the Finger Lakes, the Catskills, and Long Island, Therefore, overall it is not unusual to find New York grown Gewxc3xbcrtztraminer and Riesling, Pennsylvania rye whiskey, or marques of locally produced ciders like Original Sin on the same menu.Since their formative years, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore have welcomed immigrants of every kind to their shores, and all three have been an important gateway through which new citizens to the general United States arrive.Crab cakes were once a kind of English croquette, but over time as spices have been added they and the Maryland crab feast became two of Baltimore's signature dishes; fishing for the blue crab is a favorite summer pastime in the waters off Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware where they may grace the table at summer picnics .Historians identify several waves of migration to the United States: one from 1815 to 1860, in which some five million English, Irish, Germanic, Scandinavian, and others from northwestern Europe came to the United States; one from 1865 to 1890, in which some 10 million immigrants, also mainly from northwestern Europe, settled, and a third from 1890 to 1914, in which 15 million immigrants, mainly from central, eastern, and southern Europe (many Austrian, Hungarian, Turkish, Lithuanian, Russian, Jewish, Greek, Italian, and Romanian) settled in the United States.Together with earlier arrivals to the United States (including the indigenous Native Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, particularly in the West, Southwest, and Texas; African Americans who came to the United States in the Atlantic slave trade; and early colonial migrants from Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and elsewhere), these new waves of immigrants had a profound impact on national or regional cuisine.Other preparations include clams casino, clams on the half shell served stuffed with herbs like oregano and streaky bacon.The fruits of the region include the Vitis labrusca grapes used in grape juice made by companies such as Welch's, along with jelly, Kosher wine by companies like Mogen David and Manischewitz along with other wineries that make higher quality winesThough not anywhere near as productive a region as the top three apple producing regions, Apples have been a staple of New England foodways since at least the 1640s and it is here that a very high amount of heirloom varieties are found, many of them gaining renewed interest as part of locavore movements and the re-emergence of cider as a beverage of choice.Southern California has several additions like five spice powder, rosemary, curry powder, kimchi, and lemongrass, with many of these brought by recent immigration to the region and often a feature of Southern California's fusion cuisine, popular in fine dining.In Texas, the local barbecue is often entirely made up of beef brisket or large rib racks, where the meat is seasoned with a spice rub and cooked over coals of mesquite, and in other portions of the state they smoke their meat and peppery sausages over high heat using pecan, apple, and oak and served it with a side of pickled vegetables, a legacy of German and Czech settlers of the late 1800s. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> "He is a hero who led a clear struggle for the values of the people"., "Shir-e-Panjshir"), earned for his role during the Soviet occupation, is a rhyming play on words in Persian, as the name of the valley means "five lions".The Wall Street Journal referred to Massoud as "The Afghan Who Won the Cold War", referring to the global significance of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan for the subsequent collapse of the Eastern Bloc.Although Pakistan were supporting the mujahideen groups during the Soviet-Afghan War, Ahmad Shah Massoud increasingly distrusted the Pakistanis and eventually kept his distance from them.In the spring 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud addressed the European Parliament in Brussels, saying that Pakistan was behind the situation in Afghanistan.Declassified Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) documents from November 2001 show that Massoud had gained "limited knowledge... regarding the intentions of Al-Qaeda to perform a terrorist act against the U.S. on a scale larger than the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania."In 2005 Sediqa Massoud published a personal account on her life with Massoud (co-authored by two women's rights activists and friends of Sediqa Massoud, Chxc3xa9kxc3xa9ba Hachemi and ) called "Pour l'amour de Massoud" (For the love of Massoud), in which she describes a decent and loving husband.Massoud liked reading and had a library of 3,000 books at his home in Panjshir.Massoud's family since his death have had a great deal of prestige in the politics of Afghanistan.They agreed to work under the banner of the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah in Rome.In November 2000, leaders from all ethnic groups were brought together in Massoud's headquarters in northern Afghanistan, travelling from other parts of Afghanistan, Europe, the United States, Pakistan and India to discuss a Loya Jirga for a settlement of Afghanistan's problems and to discuss the establishment of a post-Taliban government.In early 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud with leaders from all ethnicities of Afghanistan addressed the European Parliament in Brussels, asking the international community to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan."Investigative commissionIn April 2003, the Karzai administration announced the creation of a commission to investigate the assassination of Massoud.Massoud was the only chief Afghan leader who never left Afghanistan in the fight against the Soviet Union and later in the fight against the Taliban Emirate.Today Panjshir, the home of Massoud,The road near the Afghanistan Embassy is a "symbol of ties" that binds the two nations that have always "enjoyed excellent relations".His friend Abdullah Abdullah said that Massoud was different from the other guerilla leaders.Also In the 1990s, India had run a field hospital at Farkor on the Tajik-Afghan border to treat wounded fighters from the then Northern Alliance that was battling the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.It was at the very same hospital that the Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Masood was pronounced dead after being assassinated just two days before the 9/11 terror strikes in 2001.In April 2001, the president of the European Parliament, Nicole Fontaine (who called Massoud the "pole of liberty in Afghanistan"), invited Massoud with the support of French and Belgian politicians to address the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium. </my-abstract>

<title>Atlantis</title>
<wiki-abstract> Atlantis (, "island of Atlas") is a fictional island mentioned in an allegory on the hubris of nations in Plato's works Timaeus and Critias, where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges "Ancient Athens", the pseudo-historic embodiment of Plato's ideal state in The Republic. In the story, Athens repels the Atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the known world,Plato's contemporaries pictured the world as consisting of only Europe, Northern Africa, and Western Asia (see the map of Hecataeus of Miletus). Atlantis, according to Plato, had conquered all Western parts of the known world, making it the literary counter-image of Persia. See  }} supposedly bearing witness to the superiority of Plato's concept of a state. The story concludes with Atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the Atlantic Ocean. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Proponents of both Atlantis as a metaphorical myth and Atlantis as history have argued that the pronoun refers to Crantor.Alan Cameron argues that the pronoun should be interpreted as referring to Plato, and that, when Proclus writes that "we must bear in mind concerning this whole feat of the Athenians, that it is neither a mere myth nor unadorned history, although some take it as history and others as myth", he is treating "Crantor's view as mere personal opinion, nothing more; in fact he first quotes and then dismisses it as representing one of the two unacceptable extremes".Cameron also points out that whether he refers to Plato or to Crantor, the statement does not support conclusions such as Otto Muck's "Crantor came to Sais and saw there in the temple of Neith the column, completely covered with hieroglyphs, on which the history of Atlantis was recorded.By tapping into their collective consciousness, the "Akashic Records" (a term borrowed from Theosophy), He also asserted that Atlantis would "rise" again in the 1960s (sparking much popularity of the myth in that decade) and that there is a "Hall of Records" beneath the Egyptian Sphinx which holds the historical texts of Atlantis.As continental drift became widely accepted during the 1960s, and the increased understanding of plate tectonics demonstrated the impossibility of a lost continent in the geologically recent past, most "Lost Continent" theories of Atlantis began to wane in popularity.Plato scholar Julia Annas, Regents Professor of Philosophy at the University of Arizona, had this to say on the matter:One of the proposed explanations for the historical context of the Atlantis story is a warning of Plato to his contemporary fourth-century fellow-citizens against their striving for naval power.Kenneth Feder points out that Critias's story in the Timaeus provides a major clue.The anthropologist Juan Villarxc3xadas-Robles, who works with the Spanish National Research Council, said, "Richard Freund was a newcomer to our project and appeared to be involved in his own very controversial issue concerning King Solomon's search for ivory and gold in Tartessos, the well documented settlement in the Doxc3xb1ana area established in the first millennium BC", and described Freund's claims as "fanciful".A similar theory had previously been put forward by a German researcher, Rainer W. Kxc3xbchne, that is based only on satellite imagery and places Atlantis in the Marismas de Hinojos, north of the city of Cxc3xa1diz.Several writers have speculated that Antarctica is the site of Atlantis.The creation of Utopian and dystopian fictions was renewed after the Renaissance, most notably in Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (1627), the description of an ideal society that he located off the western coast of America.But more probably he contemplated some unknown land in the far west beyond the ocean, like the fabled Atlantis of Plato& ..."Other early Christian writers wrote about Atlantis, although they had mixed views on whether it once existed or was an untrustworthy myth of pagan origin.Cosmas Indicopleustes in the sixth century wrote of Atlantis in his Christian Topography in an attempt to prove his theory that the world was flat and surrounded by water: when scholars began to identify Atlantis with the New World.b'      DESCRIPTION: Fictional island in Plato's works, now a synonym for supposed prehistoric lost civilizations.Atlantis (, "island of Atlas") is a fictional island mentioned in an allegory on the hubris of nations in Plato's works Timaeus and Critias, The story concludes with Atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the Atlantic Ocean.Despite its minor importance in Plato's work, the Atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It tells of the hedonistic lifestyle Augustine lived for a time within his youth, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits; his following and leaving of the anti-sex and anti-marriage Manichaeism in attempts to seek sexual morality; and his subsequent return to Christianity due to his embracement of Skepticism and the New Academy movement (developing the view that sex is good, and that virginity is better, comparing the former to silver and the latter to gold; Augustine's views subsequently strongly influenced Western theologyIn the spirit of Augustine's Confessions is the 12th-century Historia Calamitatum of Peter Abelard, outstanding as an autobiographical document of its period.In the 15th century, Leonor Lxc3xb3pez de Cxc3xb3rdoba, a Spanish noblewoman, wrote her Memorias, which may be the first autobiography in Castillian.Zxc4x81hir ud-Dxc4xabn Mohammad Bxc4x81bur, who founded the Mughal dynasty of South Asia kept a journal Bxc4x81burnxc4x81ma (Chagatai/; literally: "Book of Babur" or "Letters of Babur") which was written between 1493 and 1529.One of the first great autobiographies of the Renaissance is that of the sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini (1500xe2x80x931571), written between 1556 and 1558, and entitled by him simply Vita (Italian: Life). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> During these early years, Arcadius was under the tutelage of the rhetorician Themistius and Arsenius Zonaras, a monk.As emperors, both of Theodosius' sons revealed themselves to have weak characters and therefore were able to be dominated by ambitious subordinates.The first crisis facing the young emperor was the rebellion of the Visigoths in 395, under the command of Alaric I, who sought to take advantage of the accession of two inexperienced Roman Emperors.While Eutropius consolidated his hold on power in the capital, the distracted government continued to turn a blind eye to the presence of Alaric in Greece.Eutropius' influence lasted four years, during which time he sought to marginalise the military and promote the civilian offices within the bureaucracy. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The estimated number of Arabs in countries outside the Arab League is estimated at 17.5 million, yielding a total of close to 384 million.According to the Charter of the Arab League (also known as the Pact of the League of Arab States), the League of Arab States is composed of independent Arab states that are signatories to the Charter.Although all Arab states have Arabic as an official language, there are many non-Arabic-speaking populations native to the Arab world.*: 81% (84/104)xe2x88x92xe2x88x92xe2x88x92Saudi Arabs: J-M267 (Y-DNA) (71.02%), J-M172 (2.68%), A (0.83%), B (1.67%), E1b1a (1.50%), E1b1b (11.05%), G (1.34%), H (0.33%), L (1.00%), Q (1.34%), R1a (2.34%), R1b (0.83%), T (2.51%), UP (1.50%).Listed among the booty captured by the army of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III in the Battle of Qarqar (853 BCE) are 1000 camels of "Gi-in-di-bu'u the ar-ba-a-a" or "[the man] Gindibu belonging to the Arabs" (ar-ba-a-a being an adjectival nisba of the noun xcaxbfarab).The related word xcaxbeaxcaxbfrxc4x81b is used to refer to Bedouins today, in contrast to xcaxbfarab which refers to Arabs in general.The oldest surviving indication of an Arab national identity is an inscription made in an archaic form of Arabic in 328 CE using the Nabataean alphabet, which refers to Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr as 'King of all the Arabs'.The most popular Arab account holds that the word Arab came from an eponymous father named Ya'rub, who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic.Tunisian Arabs: E1b1b (49.3%), J1 (35.8%), R1b (6.8%) and E1b1a1-M2 (1.4%).The mtDNA haplogroup J has been observed at notable frequencies among overall populations in the Arab world.There are four principal West Eurasian autosomal DNA components that characterize the populations in the Arab world: the Arabian, Levantine, Coptic and Maghrebi components.The Arabian component is the main autosomal element in the Persian Gulf region.The Book of Genesis narrates that God promised Hagar to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.<sup>()</sup> The Book of Jubilees claims that the sons of Ishmael intermingled with the 6 sons of Keturah, from Abraham, and their descendants were called Arabs and Ishmaelites:Assyrian and Babylonian Royal Inscriptions and North Arabian inscriptions from 9th to 6th century BCE, mention the king of Qedar as king of the Arabs and King of the Ishmaelites.Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddima distinguishes between sedentary Arab Muslims who used to be nomadic, and Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert.Thus, although a more limited diffusion of Arab culture and language was felt in some areas by these migrant minority Arabs in pre-Islamic times through Arabic-speaking Christian kingdoms and Jewish tribes, it was only after the rise of Islam in the mid-7th century that Arab culture, people and language began their wholesale spread from the central Arabian Peninsula (including the south Syrian desert) through conquest and trade.Arabs in the narrow sense are the indigenous Arabians who trace their roots back to the tribes of Arabia and their immediate descendant groups in the Levant and North Africa.The Rashidun state was a completely new state and unlike the Arab kingdoms of its century such as the Himyarite, Lakhmids or Ghassanids.The Great Mosque of Kairouan in [[Kairouan, Tunisia was founded in 670 by the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi; it is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb and represents an architectural testimony of the Arab conquest of North Africa]]In 661, the Rashidun Caliphate fell into the hands of the Umayyad dynasty and Damascus was established as the empire's capital. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> )The armadillo is also a natural reservoir for Chagas disease.The nine-banded armadillo also serves science through its unusual reproductive system, in which four genetically identical offspring are born, the result of one original egg.Armadillos (mainly Dasypus) are common roadkill due to their habit of jumping 3xe2x80x934& ft vertically when startled, which puts them into collision with the underside of vehicles.Armadillo shells have traditionally been used to make the back of the charango, an Andean lute instrument.In certain parts of Central and South America, armadillo meat is eaten; it is a popular ingredient in Oaxaca, Mexico.Two species, the northern naked-tailed armadillo and nine-banded armadillo, are found in Central America; the latter has also reached the United States, primarily in the south-central states (notably Texas), but with a range that extends as far east as North Carolina and Florida, and as far north as southern Nebraska and southern Indiana.The nine-banded armadillo is noted for its movement through waterGestation lasts from 60 to 120 days, depending on species, although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits delayed implantation, so the young are not typically born for eight months after mating. </my-abstract>

<title>Antisemitism in the Arab world</title>
<wiki-abstract> Antisemitism in the Arab world has increased greatly since the beginning of the 20th century, for several reasons: the dissolution and breakdown of the Ottoman Empire and traditional Islamic society; European influence, brought about by Western imperialism and Arab Christians;Lewis (1986), p. 132 Nazi propaganda and relations between Nazi Germany and the Arab world;Yadlin, Rifka. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> </blockquote>George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the Arab world to the defeat and breakdown of the Ottoman Empire and traditional Islamic society; domination by Western colonial powers under which Jews gained a disproportionately large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of Arab nationalism, whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment over Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular Arab regimes to scapegoat local Jews for political purposes.After the 1948 Arabxe2x80x93Israeli War, the Palestinian exodus, the creation of the state of Israel, and the independence of Arab countries from European control, conditions for Jews in the Arab world deteriorated.But I, personally and in light of this imaginary tale, complain to Hitler, even saying to him from the bottom of my heart, 'If only you had done it, brother, if only it had really happened, so that the world could sigh in relief [without] their evil and sin.'</blockquote>In an article in October 2000 columnist Adel Hammoda alleged in the state-owned Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram that Jews made Matza from the blood of (non-Jewish) children.In August 2010, Saudi columnist Iman Al-Quwaifli sharply criticized the "phenomenon of sympathy for Adolf Hitler and for Nazism in the Arab world",In an October 2012 sermon broadcast on Egyptian Channel 1 (which was attended by Egyptian President Muhammad Morsi) Futouh Abd Al-Nabi Mansour, the Head of Religious Endowment of the Matrouh Governorate, prayed (as translated by MEMRI):Jordan does not allow entry to Jews with visible signs of Judaism or even with personal religious items in their possession.Antisemitism is also malleable enough that it can unite right-wing and left-wing groups within the Arab world.Robert Bernstein, founder of Human Rights Watch, says that antisemitism is "deeply ingrained and institutionalized" in "Arab nations in modern times".In 2003, Israeli-Arab Raed Salah, the leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel published the following poem in the Islamic Movement's periodical:You Jews are criminal bombers of mosques,<br>Slaughterers of pregnant women and babies.<br>Robbers and germs in all times,<br>The Creator sentenced you to be loser monkeys,<br>Victory belongs to Muslims, from the Nile to the Euphrates.During a speech in 2007, Salah accused Jews of using children's blood to bake bread. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The exception is the suffix  in verb endings where  is silent, resulting in  or .In addition, when transliterating names and loanwords, Arabic language speakers write out most or all the vowels as long ( with <big></big> ,  and  with <big></big> , and  and  with <big></big> ), meaning it approaches a true alphabet.The diphthongs  and  are represented in vocalized text as follows:An Arabic syllable can be open (ending with a vowel) or closed (ending with a consonant):A normal text is composed only of a series of consonants plus vowel-lengthening letters; thus, the word qalb, "heart", is written qlb, and the word qalaba "he turned around", is also written qlb.To write qalaba without this ambiguity, we could indicate that the l is followed by a short a by writing a fatxe1xb8xa5ah above it.To write qalb, we would instead indicate that the l is followed by no vowel by marking it with a diacritic called sukxc5xabn (), like this: .This is one step down from full vocalization, where the vowel after the q would also be indicated by a fatxe1xb8xa5ah: .The Qurxcaxbexc4x81n is traditionally written in full vocalization.The long i sound in some editions of the Qurxe2x80x99xc4x81n is written with a kasrah followed by a diacritic-less y, and long u by a xe1xb8x8dammah followed by a bare w. In others, these y and w carry a sukxc5xabn.The system was finalized around 786 by .Although Napoleon Bonaparte generally receives credit for introducing the printing press to Egypt during his invasion of that country in 1798, and though he did indeed bring printing presses and Arabic script presses to print the French occupation's official newspaper Al-Tanbiyyah ("The Courier"), printing in the Arabic language started several centuries earlier.In 1514, following Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1450, Gregorio de Gregorii, a Venetian, published an entire prayer-book in Arabic script; it was entitled Kitab Salat al-Sawa'i and was intended for eastern Christian communities.Between 1580 and 1586, type designer Robert Granjon designed Arabic typefaces for Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici, and the Medici press published many Christian prayer and scholarly Arabic texts in the late 16th century.Maronite monks at the Maar Quzhayy Monastery in Mount Lebanon published the first Arabic books to use movable type in the Middle East.[http://www.yamli.com/editor/ Yamli editor], which allow entry of Arabic letters without having Arabic support installed on a PC, and without knowledge of the layout of the Arabic keyboard.The first software program of its kind in the world that identifies Arabic handwriting in real time was developed by researchers at Ben-Gurion University (BGU).The prototype enables the user to write Arabic words by hand on an electronic screen, which then analyzes the text and translates it into printed Arabic letters in a thousandth of a second.The letter xd9x86 (n) also has the same form in initial and medial forms, with one dot above, though it is somewhat different in isolated and final form.Both printed and written Arabic are cursive, with most of the letters within a word directly connected to the adjacent letters.There are two main collating sequences for the Arabic alphabet: abjad and hija.The original  order (), used for lettering, derives from the order of the Phoenician alphabet, and is therefore similar to the order of other Phoenician-derived alphabets, such as the Hebrew alphabet.b'      DESCRIPTION: Alphabet for Arabic and other languages.{ }The Arabic alphabet (,  or , , ), or Arabic abjad, is the Arabic script as it is codified for writing Arabic.In addition, some letter combinations are written as ligatures (special shapes), notably  ,(also& <big></big>& )(also& & )(also& & )(also& & )("guttural" h, may be approximated as <u>h</u>eart)(also& ,& ,& & )(also& & )(also& & )(also& & )(can be approximated with sauce, but with the throat constricted)(also& & )(can be approximated with dawn, but with the throat constricted)(also& & )(can be approximated with stall, but with the throat constricted)(also& & )(can be approximated with father, but with the throat constricted)("guttural" voiced h; similar to xe1xb8xa5xc4x81xcaxbe above)(also& ,& & )French Paris(similar to caught, but pronounced further back in the mouth. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> They were able to incorporate many suggestions into the retail version.In the months leading to the release of Alpha Centauri, multimedia producer Michael Ely wrote the 35 weekly episodes of Journey to Centauri detailing the splintering of the U.N. mission to Alpha Centauri.A month after Alpha Centauris February 1999 release, the Firaxis team began work on the expansion pack, Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire.}}The game showed well at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3).Alpha Centauri's science fiction storyline received high praise; IGN considered the game an exception to PC sci-fi cliches, The Adrenaline Vault's Pete Hines said, "While Alpha Centauri is the evolutionary off-spring to [Civilization] and [Civilization II], it is not [Civilization II] in space.Players may customize the game by choosing options at the beginning of the game, using the built-in scenario and map editors, and modifying Alpha Centauris game files.In 1996, MicroProse released the lauded Civilization II, designed by Brian Reynolds.With no previous experience in science fiction games, the developers believed future history was a fitting first foray.Alpha Centauri set out to capture the whole sweep of humanity's future, including technology, futuristic warfare, social and economic development, the future of the human condition, spirituality, and philosophy.Terraforming is a natural outgrowth of colonizing an alien world.The game's cutscenes use montages of live-action video, CGI, or both; most of the former is from the 1992 experimental documentary Baraka.In July 1996, Firaxis began work on Alpha Centauri,Reynolds said that the most important principle of game design is for the designer to play the game as it is developed; Reynolds then taught the computer his reasoning process so the AI could find the right choice when presented several attractive possibilities.Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, was invited to join development as a game balancer.Around the summer of 1997, the staff began research on the scientific realities involved in interstellar travel. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Nevertheless, a fluent speaker of one of two greatly varying dialects who is also literate in one of the standards, when exposed to the other dialect for a period of time will be able to understand the other with relative ease.Distinct Western Armenian varieties currently in use include Homshetsi, spoken by the Hemshin peoples; the dialects of Armenians of Kessab (xd5x94xd5xa5xd5xbdxd5xa1xd5xbaxd5xab xd5xa2xd5xa1xd6x80xd5xa2xd5xa1xd5xbc), Latakia and Jisr al-Shughur (Syria), Anjar, Lebanon, and Vakxc4xb1flxc4xb1, Samandaxc4x9f (Turkey), part of the "Sueidia" dialect (xd5x8dxd5xb8xd6x82xd5xa7xd5xbfxd5xabxd5xa1xd5xb5xd5xab xd5xa2xd5xa1xd6x80xd5xa2xd5xa1xd5xbc).Forms of the Karin dialect of Western Armenian are spoken by several hundred thousand people in Northern Armenia, mostly in Gyumri, Artik, Akhuryan, and around 130 villages in Shirak Province,Nakhichevan-on-Don Armenians speak another Western Armenian variety based on the dialect of Armenians in Crimea, where they came from in order to establish the town and surrounding villages in 1779 (xd5x86xd5xb8xd6x80 xd5x86xd5xa1xd5xadxd5xabxd5xbbxd6x87xd5xa1xd5xb6xd5xab xd5xa2xd5xa1xd6x80xd5xa2xd5xa1xd5xbc).Western Armenian dialects are currently spoken also in Gavar (formerly Nor Bayazet and Kamo, on the west of Lake Sevan), Aparan, and Talin in Armenia (Mush dialect), and by the large Armenian population residing in Abkhazia, where they are considered to be the first or second ethnic minority, or even equal in number to the local Abkhaz populationThe Armenian alphabet ( or ) is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that is used to write the Armenian language.Conceivably, Proto-Armenian would have been located between Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian, consistent with the fact that Armenian shares certain features only with Indo-Iranian (the satem change) but others only with Greek (s > h).Graeco-Aryan has comparatively wide support among Indo-Europeanists who believe the Indo-European homeland to be located in the Armenian Highlands, the "Armenian hypothesis".Used in tandem with the Graeco-Armenian hypothesis, the Armenian language would also be included under the label Aryano-Greco-Armenic, splitting into proto-Greek/Phrygian and "Armeno-Aryan" (ancestor of Armenian and Indo-Iranian).Classical Armenian (Arm: grabar), attested from the 5th century to the 19th century as the literary standard (up to the 11th century also as a spoken language with different varieties), was partially superseded by Middle Armenian, attested from the 12th century to the 18th century.Nouns are declined for one of seven cases: nominative (xd5xb8xd6x82xd5xb2xd5xb2xd5xa1xd5xafxd5xa1xd5xb6 uxxakan), accusative (xd5xb0xd5xa1xd5xb5xd6x81xd5xa1xd5xafxd5xa1xd5xb6 hayc'akan), locative (xd5xb6xd5xa5xd6x80xd5xa3xd5xb8xd5xb5xd5xa1xd5xafxd5xa1xd5xb6 nergoyakan), genitive (xd5xbdxd5xa5xd5xbcxd5xa1xd5xafxd5xa1xd5xb6 sexe1xb9x99akan), dative (xd5xbfxd6x80xd5xa1xd5xafxd5xa1xd5xb6 trakan), ablative (xd5xa2xd5xa1xd6x81xd5xa1xd5xbcxd5xa1xd5xafxd5xa1xd5xb6 bac'axe1xb9x99akan), or instrumental (xd5xa3xd5xb8xd6x80xd5xaexd5xabxd5xa1xd5xafxd5xa1xd5xb6 gorciakan).;Examples of noun declension in Eastern ArmenianAnimate nouns do not decline for locative case.;Examples of noun declension in Western ArmenianVerbs in Armenian have an expansive system of conjugation with two main verb types in Eastern Armenian and three in Western Armenian changing form based on tense, mood and aspect.Armenian is a pluricentric language, having two modern standardized forms: Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> As a result, only a finite number of sinusoidal terms with frequencies that lie within the audible range are modeled in additive synthesis.A waveform or function is said to be periodic iffor all <math> t ,</math> and for some period <math> P ,</math>.The Fourier series of a periodic function is mathematically expressed as:  y(t) &= frac{a_0}{2} + sum_{k=1}^{infty} left[ a_k cos(2 pi k f_0 t ) - b_k sin(2 pi k f_0 t ) right]        &= frac{a_0}{2} + sum_{k=1}^{infty} r_k cosleft(2 pi k f_0 t + phi_k right)    end{align} </math>whereBeing inaudible, the DC component, <math>a_0/2,</math>, and all components with frequencies higher than some finite limit, <math>K f_0,</math>, are omitted in the following expressions of additive synthesis.The simplest harmonic additive synthesis can be mathematically expressed as:where <math>y(t),</math> is the synthesis output, <math>r_k,</math>, <math>k f_0,</math>, and <math>phi_k,</math> are the amplitude, frequency, and the phase offset, respectively, of the <math>k,</math>th harmonic partial of a total of <math>K,</math> harmonic partials, and <math>f_0,</math> is the fundamental frequency of the waveform and the frequency of the musical note.More generally, the amplitude of each harmonic can be prescribed as a function of time, <math>r_k(t),</math>, in which case the synthesis output isEach envelope <math>r_k(t),</math> should vary slowly relative to the frequency spacing between adjacent sinusoids.The sampling period is <math>T=1/f_mathrm{s},</math>.Beginning with (),and sampling at discrete times <math> t = nT = n/f_mathrm{s} ,</math> results in y[n] & = y(nT) = sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) cosleft(2 pi int_0^{nT} f_k(u) du + phi_k right)       & = sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) cosleft(2 pi sum_{i=1}^{n} int_{(i-1)T}^{iT} f_k(u) du + phi_k right)       & = sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) cosleft(2 pi sum_{i=1}^{n} (T f_k[i]) + phi_k right)       & = sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] cosleft(frac{2 pi}{f_mathrm{s}} sum_{i=1}^{n} f_k[i] + phi_k right)        end{align} </math>whereThis is equivalent towhere    theta_k[n] &= frac{2 pi}{f_mathrm{s}} sum_{i=1}^{n} f_k[i] + phi_k                 &= theta_k[n-1] + frac{2 pi}{f_mathrm{s}} f_k[n]        end{align} </math> for all <math>n>0,</math>and'The bandwidth of <math>r_k(t),</math> should be significantly less than <math>f_0,</math>.Additive synthesis can also produce inharmonic sounds (which are aperiodic waveforms) in which the individual overtones need not have frequencies that are integer multiples of some common fundamental frequency. ([https://ccrma.stanford.edu/STANM/stanms/stanm43/stanm43.pdf online reprint])</ref>where <math>f_k,</math> is the constant frequency of <math>k,</math>th partial.In the general case, the instantaneous frequency of a sinusoid is the derivative (with respect to time) of the argument of the sine or cosine function.This is the case whether the partial is harmonic or inharmonic and whether its frequency is constant or time-varying.In the most general form, the frequency of each non-harmonic partial is a non-negative function of time, <math>f_k(t),</math>, yieldingAdditive synthesis more broadly may mean sound synthesis techniques that sum simple elements to create more complex timbres, even when the elements are not sine waves.Modern-day implementations of additive synthesis are mainly digital. </my-abstract>

<title>Aircraft carrier</title>
<wiki-abstract> An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Russian, Chinese, and future Indian carriers include a ski-jump ramp for launching lightly loaded conventional fighter aircraft but recover using traditional carrier arresting cables and a tailhook on their aircraft.The disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size, payload, and fuel load (and thus range); heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck, or assistance from a catapult or JATO rocket.A ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas; this flat deck limits the loading of Harriers but is somewhat mitigated by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many STOVL carriers.List of aircraft carriers by country|List of aircraft carriers in service}}The U.S. Navy has the largest fleet of carriers in the world, and currently has eleven supercarriers in service.The P-700 systems will be removed in the coming refit to enlarge her below decks aviation facilities as well as upgrading her defensive systems.;Current2  18,860-tonne full deck amphibious assault ship with hospital and well deck and facilities to serve as fleet flagship.;FutureSouth Korea believes it can procure 2 light aircraft carriers by 2036, which will help make the ROKN a blue water navy.;Current1 offshore helicopter support ship:  helicopter carrier: 11,400-tonne STOVL carrier based on Spanish  design.Today's aircraft carriers are so expensive that some nations which operate them risk significant economic and military impact if a carrier is lost.Some changes were made after 1945 in carriers:Modern navies that operate such aircraft carriers treat them as the capital ship of the fleet, a role previously held by the sailing galleons, frigates and ships-of-the-line and later steam or diesel powered battleship. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> They consisted of:Although considerable revision of this phylum has been done (the order Haemosporidia now has 17 genera rather than 9),  these numbers are probably still approximately correct.Jacques Euzxc3xa9by in 1988 created a new class Haemosporidiasina by merging subclass Piroplasmasina and suborder Haemospororina.The division into Achromatorida and Chromatorida, although proposed on morphological grounds, may have a biological basis, as the ability to store haemozoin appears to have evolved only once.These form the following five taxonomic groups:# The gregarines are, in general, one-host parasites of invertebrates.# The adeleorins are one-host parasites of invertebrates or vertebrates, or two-host parasites that alternately infect haematophagous (blood-feeding) invertebrates and the blood of vertebrates.# The eimeriorins are a diverse group that includes one host species of invertebrates, two-host species of invertebrates, one-host species of vertebrates and two-host species of vertebrates.The majority are monoxenous (infect one host only), but a few are heteroxenous (lifecycle involves two or more hosts).The number of families in this later suborder is debated, with the number of families being between one and 20 depending on the authority and the number of genera being between 19 and 25.The first Apicomplexa protozoan was seen by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who in 1674 saw probably oocysts of Eimeria stiedae in the gall bladder of a rabbit. </my-abstract>

<title>Ad hominem</title>
<wiki-abstract> Ad hominem (), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a term that refers to several types of arguments, most of which are fallacious. Typically this term refers to a rhetorical strategy where the speaker attacks the character, motive, or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> All of them are similar to the general scheme of ad hominem argument, that is instead of dealing with the essence of someone's argument or trying to refute it, the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is a sufficient reason to drop the initial argument.Ad hominem tu quoque (literally: "You also") is a response to a personal attack (or ad hominem argument) that itself is a personal attack.Tu quoque appears as: Here is an example given by philosophy professor George Wrisley to illustrate the above: A businessman and politician is giving a lecture at a University about how good his company is and how nicely the system works.This kind of argument is also known as "argument from commitment".Italian polymath Galileo Galilei and British philosopher John Locke also examined the argument from commitment, a form of the ad hominem argument, meaning examining an argument on the basis of whether it stands true to the principles of the person carrying the argument. </my-abstract>

<title>Analysis of algorithms</title>
<wiki-abstract> In computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms – the amount of time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them. Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity). </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> This may be the origin of the reputation that led Bede to list him as holding overlordship over southern Britain.The historian Guy Halsall argues that as xc3x86lle immediately preceded the late sixth-century King Ceawlin as Bretwalda, it is far more likely that xc3x86lle dates to the mid sixth century, and that the Chronicle has moved his dates back a century in order to provide a foundation myth for Sussex which puts it chronologically and geographically between the origins of the kingdoms of Kent and Wessex.xc3x86lle's death is not recorded by the Chronicle, which gives no information about him, or his sons, or the South Saxons until 675, when the South Saxon king xc3x86thelwalh was baptized.It has been conjectured that, as Saxon war leader, xc3x86lle may have met his death in the disastrous battle of Mount Badon when the Britons halted Saxon expansion. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Gluck feared that the Parisian critics would denounce the opera by a young composer known mostly for comic pieces and so the opera was originally billed in the press as being a new work by Gluck with some assistance from Salieri, then shortly before the premiere of the opera the Parisian press reported that the work was to be partly by Gluck and partly by Salieri, and finally after popular and critical success on stage, the opera was acknowledged in a letter to the public by Gluck as being wholly by the young Salieri.This production was also broadcast on television.In November 2009, Il mondo alla rovescia was given its first staging in modern times at the Teatro Salieri in Legnago in a co-production between the Fondazione Culturale Antonio Salieri and the Fondazione Arena di Verona for the Salieri Opera Festival.On 14 November 2011 in Graz, Austria, the hometown of the librettist Leopold Auenbrugger, Salieri's Der Rauchfangkehrer was given its first modern production.While Italian by birth, Salieri had lived in imperial Vienna for almost 60 years and was regarded by such people as the music critic Friedrich Rochlitz as a German composer.The biographer Alexander Wheelock Thayer believes that Mozart's rivalry with Salieri could have originated with an incident in 1781, when Mozart applied to be the music teacher of Princess Elisabeth of Wxc3xbcrttemberg, and Salieri was selected instead because of his reputation as a singing teacher. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Analgesics include paracetamol (known in North America as acetaminophen or simply APAP), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as the salicylates, and opioid drugs such as morphine and oxycodone.When choosing analgesics, the severity and response to other medication determine the choice of agent; the World Health Organization (WHO) pain ladder specifies mild analgesics as its first step.Analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain: For neuropathic pain, traditional analgesics are less effective, and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics, such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants.Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen or APAP, is a medication used to treat pain and fever.These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.Dextromethorphan has been noted to slow the development of and reverse tolerance to opioids, as well as to exert additional analgesia by acting upon NMDA receptors, as does ketamine.High-alcohol liquor, two forms of which were found in the US Pharmacopoeia up until 1916 and in common use by physicians well into the 1930s, has been used in the past as an agent for dulling pain, due to the CNS depressant effects of ethyl alcohol, a notable example being the American Civil War. </my-abstract>

<title>Accusative case</title>
<wiki-abstract> The accusative case (abbreviated ) is a linguistics term for a grammatical case relating to how some languages typically mark a direct object of a transitive verb. Among those languages, analogous marking principles often apply to the objects of (some or all) prepositions. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Another factor that determines the endings of adjectives is whether the adjective is being used after a definite article (the), after an indefinite article (a/an) or without any article before the adjective (many green apples).In German, the accusative case is also used for some adverbial expressions, mostly temporal ones, as in  (This evening I'm staying at home), where  is marked as accusative, although not a direct object.In Russian, accusative is used not only to display the direct object of an action, but also to indicate the destination or goal of motion.The feminine, neutral and plural forms do not change.For example,  (dog) is a masculine () word, so the article changes when used in the accusative case:Some German pronouns also change in the accusative case.The accusative case is also used after particular German prepositions. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Further, proponents of the necessity of the personal apostolic succession of bishops within the Church point to the universal practice of the undivided early Church (up to AD 431), before it was divided into the Church of the East, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church.However, some Protestants deny the need for this type of continuity,Michael Ramsey, an English Anglican bishop and the Archbishop of Canterbury (1961xe2x80x931974), described three meanings of "apostolic succession":# One bishop succeeding another in the same see meant that there was a continuity of teaching: "while the Church as a whole is the vessel into which the truth is poured, the Bishops are an important organ in carrying out this task".# The bishops were also successors of the apostles in that "the functions they performed of preaching, governing and ordaining were the same as the Apostles had performed".# It is also used to signify that "grace is transmitted from the Apostles by each generation of bishops through the imposition of hands".He adds that this last has been controversial in that it has been claimed that this aspect of the doctrine is not found before the time of Augustine of Hippo, while others allege that it is implicit in the Church of the second and third centuries.In its 1982 statement on Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry, the Faith and Order Commission of the World Council of Churches stated that "the primary manifestation of apostolic succession is to be found in the apostolic tradition of the Church as a whole....}}The Lutheran Church of Finland was then one with the Church of Sweden and so holds the same view regarding the see of xc3x85bo/Turku.Negotiated at Jxc3xa4rvenpxc3xa4xc3xa4, Finland, and inaugurated with a celebration of the Eucharist at Porvoo Cathedral in 1992, the Porvoo Communion agreement of unity includes the mutual recognition of the traditional apostolic succession among the following Churches:Of note is the fact that at least one of the Scandinavian Lutheran Churches in the Porvoo Communion of Churches, the Church of Denmark has bishops, but strictly speaking they were not in the historic apostolic succession prior to their entry into the Porvoo Communion, since their episcopate and holy orders derived from Johannes Bugenhagen, who was a pastor, not a bishop.Similarly, in the High Church Lutheranism of Germany, some religious brotherhoods like Hochkirchliche St. Johannes-Bruderschaft and Hochkirchlicher Apostolat St. Ansgar have managed to arrange for their own bishop to be re-ordained in apostolic succession.Since the bishop, once ordained, becomes the guarantor of apostolicity and successor of the apostles; he joins together all the bishops, thus maintaining episkope of the local Churches derived from the college of the apostles.Churches that claim some form of episcopal apostolic succession, dating back to the apostles or to leaders from the apostolic era,Roman Catholics recognize the validity of the apostolic successions of the bishops, and therefore the rest of the clergy, of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Old Catholic Church (Union of Utrecht only), and Polish National Catholic Church.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints also claims apostolic succession. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The ascorbate anion is stabilized by electron delocalization that results from resonance between two forms:For this reason, ascorbic acid is much more acidic than would be expected if the compound contained only isolated hydroxyl groups.The ascorbate anion forms salts, such as sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate, and potassium ascorbate.Ascorbic acid can also react with organic acids as an alcohol forming esters such as ascorbyl palmitate and ascorbyl stearate.Nucleophilic attack of ascorbic acid on a proton results in a 1,3-diketone: The ascorbate ion is the predominant species at typical biological pH values.These compounds are water-soluble and, thus, cannot protect fats from oxidation: For this purpose, the fat-soluble esters of ascorbic acid with long-chain fatty acids (ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate) can be used as food antioxidants.It creates volatile compounds when mixed with glucose and amino acids in 90& xc2xb0C.It is a cofactor in tyrosine oxidation.UK Food Standards Agency: -ascorbic acid is as dietary supplement.Ascorbic acid is prepared in industry from glucose in a method based on the historical Reichstein process. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.Ian Barbour, in his book Issues in Science and Religion (1966), p.& 133, cites Eddington's The Nature of the Physical World (1928) for a text that argues the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for "the defense of the idea of human freedom" and his Science and the Unseen World (1929) for support of philosophical idealism "the thesis that reality is basically mental".Charles De Koninck points out that Eddington believed in objective reality existing apart from our minds, but was using the phrase "mind-stuff" to highlight the inherent intelligibility of the world: that our minds and the physical world are made of the same "stuff" and that our minds are the inescapable connection to the world.Against Albert Einstein and others who advocated determinism, indeterminismxe2x80x94championed by Eddingtonxe2x80x94says that a physical object has an ontologically undetermined component that is not due to the epistemological limitations of physicists' understanding.Eddington's criticism seems to have been based partly on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars, but to have "raised irrelevant objections" in addition, as Thanu Padmanabhan puts it.During World War I, Eddington was Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from Willem de Sitter regarding Einstein's theory of general relativity. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The only dedicated American-origin, casemate hull design fighting vehicle of any type built during the war, that resembled the German and Soviet tank destroyers in hull and general gun mounting design, was the experimental T28 Super Heavy Tank, which mounted a 105& mm T5E1 long-barrel cannon, which had a maximum firing range of 12 miles (20& km), and was originally designed as a self-propelled assault gun to breach Germany's Siegfried Line defenses.Of these tank destroyers, only the  gun of the M36 proved effective against the frontal armor of Germans' larger armored vehicles at long range.There was extra impetus given to the development of anti-tank weaponry, which culminated in the 76mm Ordnance QF 17 pounder, widely considered one of the best anti-tank guns of the war.Towed anti-tank guns were the domain of the Royal Artillery rather than the Royal Armoured Corps and vehicles adapted to mount artillery, including anti-tank self-propelled guns such as the Deacon (6pdr on an armoured wheeled truck chassis) and Archer (17pdr on tracked chassis), were their preserve, as were US-supplied vehicles.The self-propelled guns that were built in the "tank destroyer" mould came about through the desire to field the QF 17 pounder anti-tank gun and simultaneous lack of suitable standard tanks to carry it. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The adrenal glands are directly below the diaphragm, and are attached to the crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.Each adrenal gland has two distinct parts, each with a unique function, the outer adrenal cortex and the inner medulla, both of which produce hormones.The outermost zone of the adrenal cortex is the zona glomerulosa.The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones: the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.The adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens.It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans.The adrenal medulla is at the centre of each adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed Official Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did".One of the largest collections of Imperial Aramaic texts is that of the Persepolis fortification tablets, which number about five hundred.Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written.Significantly more widespread is Syriac, the liturgical language of Syriac Christianity, in particular the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Assyrian Pentecostal Church, Assyrian Evangelical Church, Ancient Church of the East, Syriac Catholic Church, the Maronite Church, Syriac was also the liturgical language of several now-extinct gnostic faiths, such as Manichaeism.Neo-Aramaic languages are still spoken today as a first language by many communities of Syriac Christians, Jews (in particular, the Kurdish Jews), and Mandaeans of Western Asia, most numerously by Chaldeans, Syriacs and Assyrians with numbers of fluent speakers ranging approximately from 1 million to 2 million, with the main languages among Assyrians being Assyrian Neo-Aramaic (590,000 speakers), Chaldean Neo-Aramaic (240,000 speakers) and Turoyo (100,000 speakers), together with a number of smaller closely related languages with no more than 5,000 to 10,000 speakers between them.As the use of the construct state almost disappears from the Middle Aramaic period on, the latter method became the main way of making possessive phrases.For example, the various forms of possessive phrases (for "the handwriting of the queen") are:# xd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x91xd7xaa xd7x9exd7x9cxd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x90 kxe1xb9xafxc4x81xe1xb8x87axe1xb9xaf malkxe1xb9xafxc3xa2 xe2x80x93 the oldest construction, also known as xd7xa1xd7x9exd7x99xd7x9bxd7x95xd7xaa sxc9x99mxc3xaexe1xb8xb5xc3xbbxe1xb9xaf : the possessed object (xd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x91xd7x94 kxe1xb9xafxc4x81bxc3xa2, "handwriting") is in the construct state (xd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x91xd7xaa kxe1xb9xafxc4x81xe1xb8x87axe1xb9xaf); the possessor (xd7x9exd7x9cxd7x9bxd7x94 malkxc3xa2, "queen") is in the emphatic state (xd7x9exd7x9cxd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x90 malkxe1xb9xafxc3xa2)# xd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x91xd7xaaxd7x90 xd7x93xd7x9exd7x9cxd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x90 kxe1xb9xafxc4x81xe1xb8x87txc3xa2 d(xc3xae)-malkxe1xb9xafxc3xa2 xe2x80x93 both words are in the emphatic state and the relative particle -[xd7x93[xd7x99 d[xc3xae]- is used to mark the relationship# xd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x91xd7xaaxd7x94 xd7x93xd7x9exd7x9cxd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x90 kxe1xb9xafxc4x81xe1xb8x87txc4x81h d(xc3xae)-malkxe1xb9xafxc3xa2 xe2x80x93 both words are in the emphatic state, and the relative particle is used, but the possessed is given an anticipatory, pronominal ending (xd7x9bxd7xaaxd7x91xd7xaaxd7x94 kxe1xb9xafxc4x81xe1xb8x87txc4x81-h, "handwriting-her"; literally, "her writing, that (of) the queen").In Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common.(That use of written Aramaic subsequently led to the adoption of the Aramaic alphabet andxe2x80x94as logogramsxe2x80x94some Aramaic vocabulary in the Pahlavi scripts, which were used by several Middle Iranian languages, including Parthian, Middle Persian, Sogdian, and Khwarazmian).Aramaic's long history and diverse and widespread use has led to the development of many divergent varieties, which are sometimes considered dialects, though they have become distinct enough over time that they are now sometimes considered as separate languages.These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic, and shows a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.In the East, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic.The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BC Achaemenid administration of Bactria and Sogdia.Biblical Aramaic is the Aramaic found in four discrete sections of the Hebrew Bible:Biblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect.A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see Peshitta).It is generally believed by Christian scholars that in the first century, Jews in Judea primarily spoke Aramaic with a decreasing number using Hebrew as their first language, though many learned Hebrew as a liturgical language. </my-abstract>

The figure buildup of actinoids is a table of nuclides with the number of neutrons on the horizontal axis (isotopes) and the number of protons on the horizontal axis (elements).Protactinium-233 is a xcexb2-emitter with a half-life of 26.97 days.There are 26 known isotopes of uranium, having mass numbers 215xe2x80x93242 (except 220 and 241).There are 24 isotopes of neptunium with mass numbers of 219, 220, and 223xe2x80x93244;Eighteen isotopes of americium are known with mass numbers from 229 to 247 (with the exception of 231).Among 19 isotopes of curium, ranging in mass number from 233 to 251,Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.Seventeen isotopes of berkelium were identified with mass numbers 233xe2x80x93234, 236, 238, and 240xe2x80x93252.The 20 isotopes of californium with mass numbers 237xe2x80x93256 are formed in nuclear reactors;Among the 18 known isotopes of einsteinium with mass numbers from 240 to 257, the most affordable is <sup>253</sup>Es.All actinides form AnH.File:Uranyl Nitrate.jpg|Uranyl nitrate (UO)File:U Oxstufen.jpg|Aqueous solutions of uranium III, IV, V, VI saltsFile:Np ox st .jpg|Aqueous solutions of neptunium III, IV, V, VI, VII saltsFile:Plutonium in solution.jpg|Aqueous solutions of plutonium III, IV, V, VI, VII saltsFile:UCl4.jpg|Uranium tetrachlorideFile:Uranium hexafluoride crystals sealed in an ampoule.jpg|Uranium hexafluorideFile:Yellowcake.jpg|U (yellowcake)Some actinides can exist in several oxide forms such as An are basic, they easily react with water, forming bases:These bases are poorly soluble in water and by their activity are close to the hydroxides of rare-earth metals.Np(OH) are also known, as are tetravalent hydroxides for Np, Pu and Am and pentavalent for Np and Am.The strongest base is of actinium.Several other thorium isotopes have half-lives over a day; all of these are also transient in the decay chains of <sup>232</sup>Th, <sup>235</sup>U, and <sup>238</sup>U.28 isotopes of protactinium are known with mass numbers 212xe2x80x93239 as well as three excited isomeric states.While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position.All actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on Earth. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The book was published in November 2008, and is reported to reveal unpublished works in which Miller "bitterly attack[ed] the injustices of American racism long before it was taken up by the civil rights movement".In his book Trinity of Passion, author Alan M. Wald conjectures that Miller was "a member of a writer's unit of the Communist Party around 1946," using the pseudonym Matt Wayne, and editing a drama column in the magazine The New Masses.In 1999 the writer Christopher Hitchens attacked Miller for comparing the Monica Lewinsky investigation to the Salem witch hunt.He was inducted in 1979.In 1993 he received the Four Freedoms Award for Freedom of Speech.In 2017 his daughter, Rebecca Miller, a writer and filmmaker, completed a documentary about her father's life, under the title Arthur Miller: Writer.Minor planet 3769 Arthurmiller is named after him.The Arthur Miller Foundation was founded to honor the legacy of Miller and his New York City Public School Education.Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high school football injury to his left kneecap.That same year his first play was produced; The Man Who Had All the Luck won the Theatre Guild's National Award.In 1947, Miller's play All My Sons, the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on Broadway (earning him his first Tony Award, for Best Author) and his reputation as a playwright was established.In 1948, Miller built a small studio in Roxbury, Connecticut. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Hence, the theoretical speedup is limited to at most 20 times the single thread performance, <math>left(dfrac{1}{1-p} = 20right)</math>.Amdahl's law can be formulated in the following way:whereFurthermore,begin{cases}S_text{latency}(s) leq dfrac 1 {1 - p} [8pt]limlimits_{s to infty} S_text{latency}(s) = dfrac 1 {1 - p}.end{cases}shows that the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task increases with the improvement of the resources of the system and that regardless of the magnitude of the improvement, the theoretical speedup is always limited by the part of the task that cannot benefit from the improvement.Amdahl's law applies only to the cases where the problem size is fixed.Consequently, the execution time of the part that does not benefit from it remains the same, while the part that benefits from it becomes:The theoretical execution time <math> T (s) </math> of the whole task after the improvement of the resources is then:Amdahl's law gives the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of the whole task at fixed workload <math> W </math>, which yieldsIf 30% of the execution time may be the subject of a speedup, p will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the affected part twice as fast, s will be& 2. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This recommendation by the INCB has been criticized as an attempt by the Board to overstep its legitimate mandate and as establishing a reason for governments to violate the human rights (i.e., religious freedom) of ceremonial ayahuasca drinkers.Under American federal law, DMT is a Schedule I drug that is illegal to possess or consume; however, certain religious groups have been legally permitted to consume ayahuascha.In 2017 the Santo Daime Church Cxc3xa9u do Montrxc3xa9al in Canada received religious exemption to use ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals.Religious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, which concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.In France, Santo Daime won a court case allowing them to use the tea in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled.In June 2019, Oakland, California, decriminalized natural entheogens.In contrast, traditionally among Amazonian tribes, the B. Caapi vine is considered to be the "spirit" of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper, and guide to the otherworldly realms.Brews similar to ayahuasca may be prepared using several plants not traditionally used in South America:DMT admixtures:MAOI admixtures:People who have consumed ayahuasca report having mystical or religious experiences and spiritual revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the universe, and deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can.Recently, ayahuasca has been found to interact specifically with the visual cortex of the brain. </my-abstract>

The word "ablative" derives from the Latin ablatus, the (irregular) perfect, passive participle of auferre "to carry away". </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> With the locative, the receding object was near the other place or object, not inside it.The Finnish ablative is also used in time expressions to indicate times of something happening (kymmeneltxc3xa4 "at ten") as well as with verbs expressing feelings or emotions.The Finnish ablative has the ending -lta or -ltxc3xa4, depending on vowel harmony.; away from a place:; from a person, object or other entity:; with the verb lxc3xa4htexc3xa4 (stop):; to smell/taste/feel/look/sound like something:The ablative case in Hungarian is used to describe movement away from, as well as a concept, object, act or event originating from an object, person, location or entity.The Latin ablative case was derived ("from the man" or "of the man") and  ("with the man"), while they considered the dative case after other prepositions or without a preposition as  to be a dative.The ablative case is found in Albanian; it is the fifth case, rasa rrjedhore.In Sanskrit, the ablative case is the fifth case (paxc3xb1camxc4xab) and has a similar function to that in Latin. </my-abstract>

<title>Adamic language</title>
<wiki-abstract> The Adamic language is, according to Jewish tradition (as recorded in the midrashim) and some Christians, the language spoken by Adam (and possibly Eve) in the Garden of Eden. It is variously interpreted as either the language used by God to address Adam (the divine language), or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things (including Eve), as in the second Genesis creation myth (). </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Because the federal agents pursuing them will not search this far north, and they are in a good location to attract ships coming south from the Alaskan gold fields, Begbick decides that they can profit by staying where they are and founding a pleasure city, where men can have fun, because there is nothing else in the world to rely on.Scene 2The news of Mahagonny spreads quickly, and sharks from all over flock to the bait, including the whore Jenny Smith, who is seen, with six other girls, singing the "Alabama Song", in which she waves goodbye to her home and sets out in pursuit of whiskey, dollars and pretty boys.Scene 3In the big cities, where men lead boring, purposeless lives, Fatty and Moses spread the gospel of Mahagonny, city of gold, among the disillusioned.Scene 4Four Alaskan Lumberjacks who have shared hard times together in the timberlands and made their fortunes set off together for Mahagonny.The opera was banned by the Nazis in 1933 and did not have a significant production until the 1960s.Weill's score uses a number of styles, including rag-time, jazz and formal counterpoint, notably in the "Alabama Song" (which has been interpreted by a range of artists, notably Ute Lemper, The Doors and David Bowie).The lyrics for the "Alabama Song" and another song, the "Benares Song" are in English (albeit specifically idiosyncratic English) and are performed in that language even when the opera is performed in its original (German) language.The name of the city itself is derived from the English word mahogany and its German language equivalent, Mahagoni.It has played in opera houses around the world.Other productions within Europe waited until the end of the Second World War, some notable ones being in January 1963 in London at Sadler's Wells Opera conducted by Colin Davis and in Berlin in September 1977 by the Komische Oper.It was not presented in the United States until 1970, when a short-lived April production at the Phyllis Anderson Theatre off Broadway starred Barbara Harris as Jenny, Frank Porretta as Jimmy, and Estelle Parsons as Begbick.A full version was presented at the Yale Repertory Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1974, with Gilbert Price as Jimmy and Stephanie Cotsirilos as Jenny. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Emperor planned to have Felix and Liberius rule jointly, but when Liberius returned Felix was forced to retire to Porto, near Rome, where, after making an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself again in Rome, he died on 22 November AD 365.This Felix was later confused with a Roman martyr named Felix, with the result that he was included in lists of the Popes as Felix II and that the succeeding Popes of the same name (Pope Felix III and Pope Felix IV) were given wrong numerals, as was Antipope Felix V.The Catholic Encyclopedia (1909) called this confusion a "distortion of the true facts" and suggested that it arose because the "Liber Pontificalis", which at this point may be registering a reliable tradition, says that this Felix built a church on the Via Aurelia, which is where the Roman martyr of an earlier date was buried.The Catholic Encyclopedia remarked that "the real story of the antipope was lost and he obtained in local Roman history the status of a saint and a confessor. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Through the sacrament a gift of the Holy Spirit is given, that renews confidence and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement, despair and anguish at the thought of death and the struggle of death; it prevents from losing Christian hope in God's justice, truth and salvation.The special grace of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick has as its effects:The duly blessed oil used in the sacrament is, as laid down in the Apostolic Constitution [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19721130_sacram-unctionem_en.html Sacram unctionem infirmorum], pressed from olives or from other plants.The Roman Rite Anointing of the Sick, as revised in 1972, puts greater stress than in the immediately preceding centuries on the sacrament's aspect of healing, and points to the place sickness holds in the normal life of Christians and its part in the redemptive work of the Church.The ritual book on pastoral care of the sick provides three rites:The actual anointing of the sick person is done on the forehead, with the prayer "Through this holy anointing may the Lord in his love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit", and on the hands, with the prayer "May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up".Other Christians too, in particular, Lutherans, Anglicans and some Protestant and other Christian communities use a rite of anointing the sick, without necessarily classifying it as a sacrament.In the Churches mentioned here by name, the oil used (called "oil of the sick" in both West and East) is blessed specifically for this purpose.An extensive account of the teaching of the Catholic Church on Anointing of the Sick is given in [http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt2art5.shtml Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1499&ndash;1532.Among some Protestant bodies, who do not consider it a sacrament, but instead as a practice suggested rather than commanded by Scripture, it is called anointing with oil.In the Greek Church the sacrament is called Euchelaion (Greek xcex95xe1xbdx90xcfx87xcexadxcexbbxcexb1xcexb9xcexbfxcexbd, from xcexb5xe1xbdx90xcfx87xcexae, "prayer", and xe1xbcx94xcexbbxcexb1xcexb9xcexbfxcexbd, "oil").The Community of Christ uses the term administration to the sick.The term "last rites" refers to administration to a dying person not only of this sacrament but also of Penance and Holy Communion, the last of which, when administered in such circumstances, is known as "Viaticum", a word whose original meaning in Latin was "provision for the journey". </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It also can undermine the extensibility of object-oriented programs.In a pure object-oriented program that uses interfaces as types, types refer to behaviors not representations.As an example, here is an implementation of the abstract stack above in the C programming language.An imperative-style interface might be:typedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;       // type: stack instance representation (opaque record)typedef stack_Rep* stack_T;               // type: handle to a stack instance (opaque pointer)typedef void* stack_Item;                 // type: value stored in stack instance (arbitrary address)stack_T stack_create(void);               // creates a new empty stack instancevoid stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item x); // adds an item at the top of the stackstack_Item stack_pop(stack_T s);          // removes the top item from the stack and returns itbool stack_empty(stack_T s);              // checks whether stack is emptyThis interface could be used in the following manner:#include <stack.h>          // includes the stack interfacestack_T s = stack_create(); // creates a new empty stack instanceint x = 17;stack_push(s, &x);          // adds the address of x at the top of the stackvoid* y = stack_pop(s);     // removes the address of x from the stack and returns itif (stack_empty(s)) { }     // does something if stack is emptyThis interface can be implemented in many ways.However, one can provide a functional-style interface even in an imperative language like C. For example:typedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;          // type: stack state representation (opaque record)typedef stack_Rep* stack_T;                  // type: handle to a stack state (opaque pointer)typedef void* stack_Item;                    // type: value of a stack state (arbitrary address)stack_T stack_empty(void);                   // returns the empty stack statestack_T stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item x); // adds an item at the top of the stack state and returns the resulting stack statestack_T stack_pop(stack_T s);                // removes the top item from the stack state and returns the resulting stack statestack_Item stack_top(stack_T s);             // returns the top item of the stack stateMany modern programming languages, such as C++ and Java, come with standard libraries that implement several common ADTs, such as those listed above.The specification of some programming languages is intentionally vague about the representation of certain built-in data types, defining only the operations that can be done on them.An "interface" typically refers only to the operations, and perhaps some of the constraints on the operations, notably pre-conditions and post-conditions, but not other constraints, such as relations between the operations.For example, an abstract stack, which is a last-in-first-out structure, could be defined by three operations: <kbd>push</kbd>, that inserts a data item onto the stack; <kbd>pop</kbd>, that removes a data item from it; and <kbd>peek</kbd> or <kbd>top</kbd>, that accesses a data item on top of the stack without removal.From this condition and from the properties of abstract variables, it follows, for example, that the sequencewhere x, y, and z are any values, and U, V, W are pairwise distinct variables, is equivalent toHere it is implicitly assumed that operations on a stack instance do not modify the state of any other ADT instance, including other stacks; that is,An abstract stack definition usually includes also a Boolean-valued function <kbd>empty</kbd>(S) and a <kbd>create</kbd>() operation that returns a stack instance, with axioms equivalent toSometimes an ADT is defined as if only one instance of it existed during the execution of the algorithm, and all operations were applied to that instance, which is not explicitly notated.Thus, for example, V xe2x86x90 V + 1 is commonly understood to be a shorthand for <kbd>store</kbd>(V,<kbd>fetch</kbd>(V) + 1).In this definition, it is implicitly assumed that storing a value into a variable U has no effect on the state of a distinct variable V. To make this assumption explicit, one could add the constraint thatMore generally, ADT definitions often assume that any operation that changes the state of one ADT instance has no effect on the state of any other instance (including other instances of the same ADT) xe2x80x94 unless the ADT axioms imply that the two instances are connected (aliased) in that sense. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen, via the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) variable region. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.RAG proteins play an important role with V(D)J recombination in cutting DNA at a particular region.After a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as allelic exclusion) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.Class switching occurs in the heavy chain gene locus by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR).Heavy chains xcexb3, xcexb1 and xcexb4 have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone.The co-expression of both of these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen.The basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) monomer (containing only one Ig unit); secreted antibodies can also be dimeric with two Ig units as with IgA, tetrameric with four Ig units like teleost fish IgM, or pentameric with five Ig units, like mammalian IgM. </my-abstract>

Filippo Neri, 1714; and others) and serenatas, which all exhibit a similar style, Scarlatti composed upwards of five hundred chamber-cantatas for solo voice. </my-abstract>

The Tickford Street facility was converted to Aston Martin Works which focuses on heritage sales, service, spares and restoration operations.More dealers in Europe and the new pair in China brought the total to 120 in 28 countries.The facility featured three existing xe2x80x98super-hangarsxe2x80x99 of MOD St Athan.In 2013, Aston Martin signed a deal with Daimler AG, which owned a 5% stake in Aston Martin, to supply the next generation of Aston Martin cars with Mercedes-AMG engines.Bamford & Martin got into financial difficulty again in 1925 and Martin was forced to sell the company (Bamford had already left).The pair had planned to sell their engine to motor manufacturers, but having heard that Aston Martin was no longer in production realised they could capitalise on its reputation to jump-start the production of a completely new car.Between 1926 and 1937 Bertelli was both technical director and designer of all new Aston Martins, since known as "Bertelli cars". </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The district hospital at the present site of Kxc3xa4lblesrain, known today as Ostalb-Klinikum, was opened in 1955.The first local newspaper, Der Bote von Aalen ("The Herald of Aalen"), has been published on Wednesdays and Saturdays since 1837.Currently, local newspapers published in Aalen are the Schwxc3xa4bische Post, which obtains its supra-regional pages from the Ulm-based Sxc3xbcdwestpresse, and the Aalener Nachrichten (erstwhile Aalener Volkszeitung), a local edition of Schwxc3xa4bische Zeitung in Leutkirch im Allgxc3xa4u.Two of Germany's biggest Lesezirkels (magazine rental services) are headquartered in Aalen: Brabandt LZ Plus Media and Lesezirkel Portal.Regional event magazines are Xaver, xc3xa5la, xc3xa5lakultur.The commercial broadcasters Radio Ton and Radio 7 have studios in Aalen.A Latin school was first recorded in Aalen in 1447; it was remodeled in 1616 and also later in various buildings that were all situated near the town church, and continued up through the 19th century.A flag on the tower signals whether the cabin's restaurant is open.The Baden-Wxc3xbcrttemberg State Institute for Environment, Measurements and Natural Conservation has laid out six protected landscapes in Aalen (the Swabian Jura escarpment between Lautern and Aalen with adjacent territories, the Swabian Jura escarpment between Unterkochen and Baiershofen, the Hilllands around Hofen, the Kugeltal and Ebnater Tal valleys with parts of Heiligental valley and adjacent territories, Laubachtal valley and Lower Lein Valley with side valleys), two sanctuary forests (Glashxc3xbctte and Kocher Origin), 65 extensive natural monuments, 30 individual natural monuments and the following two protected areas:The  large Dellenhxc3xa4ule protected area between Aalen's Waldhausen district and Neresheim's Elchingen district, created in 1969, is a sheep pasture with juniper and wood pasture of old willow oaks.The  large Goldshxc3xb6fer Sande protected area was established in 2000 and is situated between Aalen's Hofen district and Hxc3xbcttlingen.So the market district stretched from one gate to the other, however in Aalen it was not straight, but with a 90-degree curve between southern (St. Martin's) gate and eastern (Ellwangen) gate.Around 1500, the civic graveyard was relocated from the town church to St. John's Church, and in 1514, the Vierundzwanziger ("Group of 24") was the first assembly constituted by the citizens.Delegated by Wxc3xbcrttemberg's Duke Louis III, on 28 June 1575, nearly 30 years after Martin Luther's death, Jakob Andreae, professor and chancellor of the University of Txc3xbcbingen, arrived in Aalen.They are listed clockwise, beginning south, with their respective linear distances to Aalen town centre given in brackets:Oberkochen (), Essingen (), Heuchlingen (), Abtsgmxc3xbcnd (), Neuler (), Hxc3xbcttlingen (), Rainau (), Westhausen (), Lauchheim (), Bopfingen () and Neresheim (), all in the Ostalbkreis district, furthermore Heidenheim an der Brenz () and Kxc3xb6nigsbronn (), both in Heidenheim district.Aalen's territory consists of the town centre (Kernstadt) and the municipalitiesmerged from between 1938 (Unterrombach) and 1975 (Wasseralfingen, see mergings section).The municipalities merged in the course of the latest municipal reform of the 1970s are also called Stadtbezirke (quarters or districts), and are Ortschaften ("settlements") in terms of Baden-Wxc3xbcrttemberg's Gemeindeordnung (municipal code), which means, each of them has its own council elected by its respective residents (Ortschaftsrat) and is presided by a spokesperson (Ortsvorsteher).The town centre itself and the merged former municipalities consist of numerous villages (Teilorte), mostly separated by open ground from each other and having their own independent and long-standing history.In 1959, the band received its first glockenspiel from TV host Peter Frankenfeld on the occasion of a TV appearance.A famous German rapper, designer and singer, that goes under the name of Cro, was born in Aalen and lived his early years here.In the central district of Aalen, there are two museums: The xe2x80x9cAalen Limes Museum" (Limesmuseum Aalen) is located at the place of the largest Roman cavalry fort north of the Alps until about 200 AD.Aalen had been chosen because of its neutral status as a Free Imperial City.During the War of the First Coalition (1796), Aalen was looted.In 1811, the municipality of Unterrombach was formed out of some villages previously belonging to Aalen, some to the Barons of Wxc3xb6llwarth, and the eastern villages were assigned to the municipality of Unterkochen.In the age of the Napoleonic wars, the town walls were no longer of use, and in the 18th century, with the maintenance of walls, gates and towers becoming more neglected Finally, due to the fact that the funds were lacking, starting in 1800, most towers were demolished, the other buildings followed soon.Before the industrial revolution, Aalen's economy was shaped by its rural setting.However, after victories of the imperial armies at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, the Prince-Provostry of Ellwangen, which still held the right of patronage in Aalen, were able to temporarily bring Catholicism back to Aalen; however after the military successes of the Protestant Union, Protestant church practices were instituted again.On the night of 5 September 1634, It took nearly 100 years for the town to reach its population of 2,000.French troops marched through Aalen in 1688 during the Nine Years' War; however, unlike other places, they left without leaving severe damages.This building received a clock from Lauterburg,According to legend, the citizens of Aalen owe the "Spy of Aalen" (Spion von Aalen) their town having been spared from destruction by the emperor's army:The earliest record of the Old Town Hall was in 1575. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> These brain anomalies would become identifiers of what later became known as Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer discussed his findings on the brain pathology and symptoms of presenile dementia publicly on 3November 1906, at the Txc3xbcbingen meeting of the Southwest German Psychiatrists.Following the lecture, Alzheimer published a short paper summarizing his lecture; in 1907 he wrote a larger paper detailing the disease and his findings.American Solomon Carter Fuller gave a report similar to that of Alzheimer at a lecture five months before Alzheimer.Another hypothesis offered by Claire O'Brien was that Auguste Deter actually had a vascular dementing disease.Alzheimer was known for having a variety of medical interests including vascular diseases of the brain, early dementia, brain tumors, forensic psychiatry and epilepsy. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> They are also used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and several other disorders.Because of potentially lethal dietary and drug interactions, monoamine oxidase inhibitors have historically been reserved as a last line of treatment, used only when other classes of antidepressant drugs (for example selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) have failed.MAOIs have been found to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia,MAOIs can also be used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease by targeting MAO-B in particular (therefore affecting dopaminergic neurons), as well as providing an alternative for migraine prophylaxis.The guidelines recommended that antidepressant treatment be considered for:The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be used in combination with psychosocial interventions in most cases, should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are typically better tolerated than other antidepressants.American Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors that include severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and the person's preference.Antidepressants are often used in combinations with one another.The proponents of the monoamine hypothesis of depression recommend choosing the antidepressant with the mechanism of action impacting the most prominent symptomsxe2x80x94for example, they advocate that people with MDD who are also anxious or irritable should be treated with SSRIs or norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and the ones with the loss of energy and enjoyment of lifexe2x80x94with norepinephrine and dopamine enhancing drugs.The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.The problem usually begins within three days and may last for several months.A discontinuation syndrome can occur after stopping any antidepressant including selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotoninxe2x80x93norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).Methods of prevention include gradually decreasing the dose among those who wish to stop, though it is possible for symptoms to occur with tapering.Approximately 20xe2x80x9350% of people who suddenly stop an antidepressant develop an antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.SSRIs appear to cause emotional blunting, or numbness in some people who take them.The mechanism is unknown.The earliest and probably most widely accepted scientific theory of antidepressant action is the monoamine hypothesis (which can be traced back to the 1950s), which states that depression is due to an imbalance (most often a deficiency) of the monoamine neurotransmitters (namely serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine).SNRIs are sometimes also used to treat anxiety disorders, obsessivexe2x80x93compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), and for the relief of menopausal symptoms.Serotonin modulator and stimulators (SMSs), sometimes referred to more simply as "serotonin modulators", are a type of drug with a multimodal action specific to the serotonin neurotransmitter system. </my-abstract>

<title>Auger effect</title>
<wiki-abstract> The Auger effect is a physical phenomenon in which the filling of an inner-shell vacancy of an atom is accompanied by the emission of an electron from the same atom. When a core electron is removed, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of energy. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Note electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current (that of the arrow, in which the current flows "most easily"), even for types such as Zener diodes or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current.In vacuum tubes or gas-filled tubes, the anode is the terminal where current enters the tube.The word was coined in 1834 from the Greek xe1xbcx84xcexbdxcexbfxcexb4xcexbfxcfx82 (anodos), 'ascent', by William Whewell, who had been consulted At the anode, anions (negative ions) are forced by the electrical potential to react chemically and give off electrons (oxidation) which then flow up and into the driving circuit. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).In the television receiver, a sync separator circuit detects the sync voltage levels and sorts the pulses into horizontal and vertical sync.Loss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.Counting sync pulses, a video line selector picks a selected line from a TV signal, used for teletext, on-screen displays, station identification logos as well as in the industry when cameras were used as a sensor.In an analog receiver with a CRT display sync pulses are fed to horizontal and vertical timebase circuits (commonly called "sweep circuits" in the United States), each consisting of an oscillator and an amplifier.This simple CRT matrix mixing technique was replaced in later solid state designs of signal processing with the original matrixing method used in the 1954 and 1955 color TV receivers.Synchronizing pulses added to the video signal at the end of every scan line and video frame ensure that the sweep oscillators in the receiver remain locked in step with the transmitted signal, so that the image can be reconstructed on the receiver screen.  A sync separator circuit detects the sync voltage levels and sorts the pulses into horizontal and vertical sync.The horizontal synchronization pulse (horizontal sync, or HSync), separates the scan lines.The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).The format of such a signal in 525-line NTSC is:Each pre- or post- equalizing pulse consists in half a scan line of black signal: 2& xcexbcs at 0& V, followed by 30& xcexbcs at 0.3& V.Each long sync pulse consists in an equalizing pulse with timings inverted: 30& xcexbcs at 0& V, followed by 2& xcexbcs at 0.3& V.In video production and computer graphics, changes to the image are often kept in step with the vertical synchronization pulse to avoid visible discontinuity of the image.The analog television signal contains timing and synchronization information, so that the receiver can reconstruct a two-dimensional moving image from a one-dimensional time-varying signal.The first commercial television systems were black-and-white; the beginning of color television was in the 1950s.In many countries, over-the-air broadcast television of analog audio and analog video signals has been discontinued, to allow the re-use of the television broadcast radio spectrum for other services such as datacasting and subchannels.A cathode-ray tube (CRT) television displays an image by scanning a beam of electrons across the screen in a pattern of horizontal lines known as a raster.Without the operation of the horizontal oscillator and output stages, for virtually every analog television receiver since the 1940s, there will be absolutely no illumination of the CRT's face.The lack of precision timing components in early television receivers meant that the timebase circuits occasionally needed manual adjustment.If their free-run frequencies were too far from the actual line and field rates, the circuits would not be able to follow the incoming sync signals.Loss of horizontal synchronization usually resulted in an unwatchable picture; loss of vertical synchronization would produce an image rolling up or down the screen.The adjustment took the form of horizontal hold and vertical hold controls, usually on the front panel along with other common controls.The U signal is the difference between the B signal and the Y signal, also known as B minus Y (B-Y), and the V signal is the difference between the R signal and the Y signal, also known as R minus Y (R-Y). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The solvent is dried during the curing process.Pre-mixed and frozen adhesives (PMFs) are adhesives that are mixed, deaerated, packaged, and frozen.One-part adhesives harden via a chemical reaction with an external energy source, such as radiation, heat, and moisture.Ultraviolet (UV) light curing adhesives, also known as light curing materials (LCM), have become popular within the manufacturing sector due to their rapid curing time and strong bond strength.The glue gun melts the solid adhesive, then allows the liquid to pass through its barrel onto the material, where it solidifies.Thermoplastic glue may have been invented around 1940 by Procter & Gamble as a solution to the problem that water-based adhesives, commonly used in packaging at that time, failed in humid climates, causing packages to open.Anaerobic adhesives cure when in contact with metal, in the absence of oxygen.Alternatively they can be organized by whether the raw stock is of natural, or synthetic origin, or by their starting physical phase.There are two types of adhesives that harden by drying: solvent-based adhesives and polymer dispersion adhesives, also known as emulsion adhesives.The first commercially produced synthetic adhesive was Karlsons Klister in the 1920s.Applicators of different adhesives are designed according to the adhesive being used and the size of the area to which the adhesive will be applied. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Although AMD stated the firm would still produce Intel chipsets, Intel had not granted the license of  FSB to ATI.On November 15, 2007, AMD announced a new chipset series portfolio, the AMD 7-Series chipsets, covering from the enthusiast multi-graphics segment to the value IGP segment, to replace the AMD 480/570/580 chipsets and AMD 690 series chipsets, marking AMD's first enthusiast multi-graphics chipset.Since GCN's introduction with the HD 7970, five generations of the GCN architecture have been produced from 2008 through at least 2017.In September 2015, AMD separated the graphics technology division of the company into an independent internal unit called the Radeon Technologies Group (RTG) headed by Raja Koduri.As of January 2020, AMD develops the second generation RDNA graphics architecture with the aim to take on the Nvidia RTX graphics products performance leadership.In 2012, AMD's then CEO Rory Read began a program to offer semi-custom designs.Before the launch of Athlon 64 processors in 2003, AMD designed chipsets for their processors spanning the K6 and K7 processor generations.AMD completed its dual-core product portfolio for each market segment.In September 2007, AMD released the first server Opteron K10 processors, However, AMD built the Spider at 65nm, which was uncompetitive with Intel's smaller and more power-efficient 45nm.In January 2009, AMD released a new processor line dubbed Phenom II, a refresh of the original Phenom built using the 45& nm process.In March 1991, AMD released the Am386, its clone of the Intel 386 processor.In 1993, AMD introduced the first of the Am486 family of processors,Finally, in an agreement effective 1996, AMD received the rights to the microcode in Intel's x386 and x486 processor families, but not the rights to the microcode in the following generations of processors.In 1996, AMD purchased NexGen, specifically for the rights to their Nx series of x86-compatible processors. </my-abstract>

<title>Australian rules football</title>
<wiki-abstract> Australian rules football, officially known as Australian football, or simply called "Aussie rules", "football" or "footy", is a contact sport played between two teams of 18 players on an oval field, often a modified cricket ground. Points are scored by kicking the oval ball between the middle goal posts (worth six points) or between a goal and behind post (worth one point). </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Australian Football International Cup, held triennially in Melbourne since 2002, is the highest level of international competition.Although Australian rules football has not yet been a full sport at the Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games, when Melbourne hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics, which included the MCG being the main stadium, Australian rules football was chosen as the native sport to be demonstrated as per International Olympic Committee rules.The Duke of Edinburgh was among the spectators for the match, which the VAFA won by 12.9 (81) to 8.7 (55).Australian football is a sport rich in tradition and Australian cultural references, especially surrounding the rituals of gameday for players, officials and supporters.Australian football has attracted more overall interest among Australians (as measured by the Sweeney Sports report) than any other football code, and, when compared with all sports throughout the nation, has consistently ranked first in the winter reports, and most recently third behind cricket and swimming in summer.In 2006, 615,549 registered participants played Australian football in Australia.Seeking to develop a game more suited to adults and Australian conditions, the Melbourne Football Club published the first laws of Australian football in May 1859, making it the oldest of the world's major football codes.Australian football has the highest spectator attendance and television viewership of all sports in Australia, The AFL Grand Final, held annually at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, is the highest attended club championship event in the world.If the ball travels out of bounds in any other circumstances (for example, contested play results in the ball being knocked out of bounds) a boundary umpire will stand with his back to the infield and return the ball into play with a throw-in, a high backwards toss back into the field of play.. Opposition players may bump or tackle the player to obtain the ball and, when tackled, the player must dispose of the ball cleanly or risk being penalised for holding the ball unless the umpire rules no prior opportunity for disposal. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Examples of rapidly expanding fields in this area are genomics, DNA sequencing and related research in genetic fingerprinting and DNA microarray; proteomics, the analysis of protein concentrations and modifications, especially in response to various stressors, at various developmental stages, or in various parts of the body, metabolomics, which deals with metabolites; transcriptomics, including mRNA and associated fields; lipidomics - lipids and its associated fields; peptidomics - peptides and its associated fields; and metalomics, dealing with metal concentrations and especially with their binding to proteins and other molecules.Analytical chemistry has played critical roles in the understanding of basic science to a variety of practical applications, such as biomedical applications, environmental monitoring, quality control of industrial manufacturing, forensic science and so on.The recent developments of computer automation and information technologies have extended analytical chemistry into a number of new biological fields.Thermal noise is white noise meaning that the power spectral density is constant throughout the frequency spectrum.The root mean square value of the thermal noise in a resistor is given bywhere k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, R is the resistance, and <math>Delta f</math> is the bandwidth of the frequency <math> f</math>.Shot noise is a type of electronic noise that occurs when the finite number of particles (such as electrons in an electronic circuit or photons in an optical device) is small enough to give rise to statistical fluctuations in a signal.Shot noise is a Poisson process and the charge carriers that make up the current follow a Poisson distribution.Analytical chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry where, aside from QA, it is used in discovery of new drug candidates and in clinical applications where understanding the interactions between the drug and the patient are critical.Although modern analytical chemistry is dominated by sophisticated instrumentation, the roots of analytical chemistry and some of the principles used in modern instruments are from traditional techniques, many of which are still used today.Spectroscopy consists of many different applications such as atomic absorption spectroscopy, atomic emission spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, x-ray spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, dual polarization interferometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, photoemission spectroscopy, Mxc3xb6ssbauer spectroscopy and so on.Mass spectrometry measures mass-to-charge ratio of molecules using electric and magnetic fields. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Voice Print is also a professional a cappella music group in Sri Lanka.The European a cappella tradition is especially strong in the countries around the Baltic and perhaps most so in Sweden as described by Richard Sparks in his doctoral thesis The Swedish Choral Miracle in 2000.Swedish a cappella choirs have over the last 25 years won around 25% of the annual prestigious European Grand Prix for Choral Singing (EGP) that despite its name is open to choirs from all over the world (see list of laureates in the Wikipedia article on the EGP competition).The reasons for the strong Swedish dominance are as explained by Richard Sparks manifold; suffice to say here that there is a long-standing tradition, an unusually large proportion of the populations (5% is often cited) regularly sing in choirs, the Swedish choral director Eric Ericson had an enormous impact on a cappella choral development not only in Sweden but around the world, and finally there are a large number of very popular primary and secondary schools ('music schools') with high admission standards based on auditions that combine a rigid academic regimen with high level choral singing on every school day, a system that started with Adolf Fredrik's Music School in Stockholm in 1939 but has spread over the country.A cappella has gained attention in the UK in recent years, with many groups forming at British universities by students seeking an alternative singing pursuit to traditional choral and chapel singing.Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the [http://www.jabberwocks.com Jabberwocks] of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956).All-women a cappella groups followed shortly, frequently as a parody of the men's groups: the Smiffenpoofs of Smith College (1936), The Shwiffs of Connecticut College (The She-Whiffenpoofs, 1944), and The Chattertocks of Brown University (1951).Perfect Harmony features the hit music of The Jackson 5, Pat Benatar, Billy Idol, Marvin Gaye, Scandal, Tiffany, The Romantics, The Pretenders, The Temptations, The Contours, The Commodores, Tommy James & the Shondells and The Partridge Family, and has been compared to a cross between Altar Boyz and The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.The fourth a cappella musical to appear Off-Broadway, In Transit, premiered 5 October 2010 and was produced by Primary Stages with book, music, and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez, James-Allen Ford, Russ Kaplan, and Sara Wordsworth. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A string trio consists of three players, a string quartet four, a string quintet five, and so on.In most circumstances the string section is treated by the arranger as one homogeneous unit and its members are required to play preconceived material rather than improvise.A string section can be utilized on its own (this is referred to as a string orchestra)George Martin, producer and arranger for The Beatles, warns arrangers about the intonation problems when only two like instruments play in unison: "After a string quartet, I do not think there is a satisfactory sound for strings until one has at least three players on each line . </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The reasoning for rejecting Athanasius as the author usually relies on a combination of the following:# The creed originally was most likely written in Latin, but Athanasius composed in Greek.# Neither Athanasius nor his contemporaries ever mention the Creed.# It is not mentioned in any records of the ecumenical councils.# It appears to address theological concerns that developed after Athanasius died (including the filioque).# It was most widely circulated among Western Christians.The use of the creed in a sermon by Caesarius of Arles, as well as a theological resemblance to works by Vincent of Lxc3xa9rins, point to Southern Gaul as its origin. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The end of the 19th century witnessed a sharp recovery of the local economy with increasing international trade and the growth of the city harbour leading to increased exports of several products (particularly during World War I when Spain was a neutral country).During the early 20th century, Alicante was a minor capital that took profit from the benefit of Spain's neutrality during World War I, and that provided new opportunities for local industry and agriculture.The governments of regional communities were given constitutional status as nationalities, and their governments were given more autonomy, including that of the Valencian region, the Generalitat Valenciana.The Port of Alicante has been reinventing itself since the industrial decline the city suffered in the 1980s (with most mercantile traffic lost to Valencia's harbour). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> "In May 2009, following the resignation of Michael Martin as Speaker of the House of Commons, it was reported that Widdecombe was gathering support for election as interim Speaker until the next general election.In 2016, she supported Brexit during the 2016 EU referendum and, following the resignation of David Cameron, endorsed Andrea Leadsom in her candidacy for election for the leadership of the governing Conservative Party.In 2019 she returned to politics as a candidate for the Brexit Party in the European parliament elections in South West England, which were held on 23 May, though she maintained that she would still vote for the Conservatives in the local elections that took place three weeks before.Widdecombe said that her decision to stand resulted from the Government's failure to deliver Britain's departure from the EU on schedule.Jack Straw, Labour's Home Affairs spokesman at the time, said it was "degrading and unnecessary" for a woman to be shackled at any stage.In May 1997, in the context of an inquiry into a series of prison escapes, Widdecombe remarked of former Home Secretary Michael Howard, under whom she had served, that there is "something of the night" about him.In 2001, when Michael Portillo was running for leader of the Conservative Party, Widdecombe described him and his allies as "backbiters" She went on to say that, should he be appointed leader, she would never give him her allegiance.In 2009, she partially defended Carol Thatcher's use of the racial slur golliwog on Any Questions?, saying: "There is a generation to whom a golliwog is merely a toy, a generation which was much endeared by its golliwogs which grew up with them on jam jars ... and there is a generation, a new generation for whom that word is deeply offensive and one does have to make I think some allowance for the fact. </my-abstract>

<title>Alexandrine</title>
<wiki-abstract> Alexandrine is a name used for several distinct types of verse line with related metrical structures, most of which are ultimately derived from the classical French alexandrine. The line's name derives from its use in the Medieval French Roman d'Alexandre of 1170, although it had already been used several decades earlier in Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Moreover, it equally encourages the very different rhythms of iambic hexameter and dactylic tetrameter to emerge by preserving the constants of both measures: iambic hexameter:    s S <u>s S s</u> S | s S <u>s S s</u> S <u>(s)</u> dactylic tetrameter: S s <u>s S s</u> s | S s <u>s S s</u> s <u>(s)</u> Czech alexandrine:   o o <u>s S s</u> o | o o <u>s S s</u> o <u>(s)</u>In the comic book Asterix and Cleopatra, the author Goscinny inserted a pun about alexandrines: when the Druid Panoramix ("Getafix" in the English translation)  meets his Alexandrian (Egyptian) friend the latter exclaims Je suis, mon cher ami, || trxc3xa8s heureux de te voir at which Panoramix observes C'est un Alexandrin ("That's an alexandrine!The alexandrine (strictly iambic with a consistent medial caesura) became the dominant long line of the German baroque.Unlike many similar lines, the Polish alexandrine developed not from French verse but from Latin, specifically, the 13-syllable goliardic line: Latin goliardic:    o o o s S s s | o o o s S s Polish alexandrine: o o o o o S s | o o o s S s  s=unstressed syllableThough looser instances of this (nominally) 13-syllable line were occasionally used in Polish literature, it was Mikoxc5x82aj Rej and Jan Kochanowski who, in the 16th century, introduced the syllabically strict line as a vehicle for major works.The Czech alexandrine is a comparatively recent development, based on the French alexandrine and introduced by Karel Hynek Mxc3xa1cha in the 19th century.This loosening process eventually led to vers libxc3xa9rxc3xa9 and finally to vers libre.In English verse, "alexandrine" is typically used to mean "iambic hexameter": xc3x97 / xc3x97 / xc3x97 / xc2xa6 xc3x97 / xc3x97 / xc3x97 / (xc3x97)  /=ictus, a strong syllabic position; xc3x97=nonictus xc2xa6=often a mandatory or predominant caesura, but depends upon the authorWhereas the French alexandrine is syllabic, the English is accentual-syllabic; and the central caesura (a defining feature of the French) is not always rigidly preserved in English.Though English alexandrines have occasionally provided the sole metrical line for a poem, for example in lyric poems by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and Sir Philip Sidney, and in two notable long poems, Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion and Robert Browning's Fifine at the Fair, they have more often featured alongside other lines. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The angle input varied the ratio (and direction) of coupling between the "motion" input and the outputs according to the sine and cosine of the input angle.Although they did not accomplish any computation, electromechanical position servos were essential in mechanical analog computers of the "rotating-shaft" type for providing operating torque to the inputs of subsequent computing mechanisms, as well as driving output data-transmission devices such as large torque-transmitter synchros in naval computers.Other non-computational mechanisms included internal odometer-style counters with interpolating drum dials for indicating internal variables, and mechanical multi-turn limit stops.Considering that accurately controlled rotational speed in analog fire-control computers was a basic element of their accuracy, there was a motor with its average speed controlled by a balance wheel, hairspring, jeweled-bearing differential, a twin-lobe cam, and spring-loaded contacts (ship's AC power frequency was not necessarily accurate, nor dependable enough, when these computers were designed).Electronic analog computers typically have front panels with numerous jacks (single-contact sockets) that permit patch cords (flexible wires with plugs at both ends) to create the interconnections that define the problem setup.The operator manipulates these through the computer's framework.Key hydraulic components might include pipes, valves and containers.Key mechanical components might include rotating shafts for carrying data within the computer, miter gear differentials, disc/ball/roller integrators, cams (2-D and 3-D), mechanical resolvers and multipliers, and torque servos.Key electrical/electronic components might include:The core mathematical operations used in an electric analog computer are:In some analog computer designs, multiplication is much preferred to division.Its challenger was Applied Dynamics of Ann Arbor, Michigan.Although the basic technology for analog computers is usually operational amplifiers (also called "continuous current amplifiers" because they have no low frequency limitation), in the 1960s an attempt was made in the French ANALAC computer to use an alternative technology: medium frequency carrier and non dissipative reversible circuits.In the 1970s every big company and administration concerned with problems in dynamics had a big analog computing center, for example:Analog computing devices are fast, digital computing devices are more versatile and accurate, so the idea is to combine the two processes for the best efficiency.However, in most cases the precision of an analog computer is absolutely sufficient given the uncertainty of the model characteristics and its technical parameters.Many small computers dedicated to specific computations are still part of industrial regulation equipment, but from the 1950s to the 1970s, general-purpose analog computers were the only systems fast enough for real time simulation of dynamic systems, especially in the aircraft, military and aerospace field.In the 1960s, the major manufacturer was Electronic Associates of Princeton, New Jersey, with its 231R Analog Computer (vacuum tubes, 20 integrators) and subsequently its EAI 8800 Analog Computer (solid state operational amplifiers, 64 integrators). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A minute of arc is |}} of a radian.A second of arc, arcsecond (arcsec), or arc second, denoted by the symbol <math></math>,}}) of a radian.These units originated in Babylonian astronomy as sexagesimal subdivisions of the degree; they are used in fields that involve very small angles, such as astronomy, optometry, ophthalmology, optics, navigation, land surveying, and marksmanship.To express even smaller angles, standard SI prefixes can be employed; the milliarcsecond (mas) and microarcsecond (xcexbcas), for instance, are commonly used in astronomy.The number of square arcminutes in a complete sphere is <math>4 pi left(tfrac{10,800}{pi}right)^2 = tfrac{466,560,000}{pi} approx </math>  square arcminutes (the surface area of a unit sphere in square units, divided by the solid angle area subtended by a square arcminute (also in square units), so that the final result is a dimensionless number).The fact that the terms "minute" and "second" also denote units of time derives from Babylonian astronomy, where the corresponding time-related terms denoted the duration of the Sun's apparent motion of one minute or one second of arc, respectively, through the ecliptic.The subtension is linear with the distance, for example, at 500 yards, 1& MOA subtends 5.235 inches, and at 1000 yards 1& MOA subtends 10.47 inches.Since many modern telescopic sights are adjustable in half (), quarter () or eighth () MOA increments, also known as clicks, zeroing and adjustments are made by counting 2, 4 and 8 clicks per MOA respectively.For example, if the point of impact is 3 inches high and 1.5 inches left of the point of aim at 100 yards (which for instance could be measured by using a spotting scope with a calibrated reticle), the scope needs to be adjusted 3 MOA down, and 1.5 MOA right. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> was the national anthem of both Romania (which adopted it in 1990) and Moldova, but in the case of the latter was replaced by the current Moldovan national anthem, "Limba noastrxc4x83".The modern national anthem of Germany, "Das Lied der Deutschen", uses the same tune as the 19th and early 20th-century Austro-Hungarian royal anthem "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser".The "Hymn of the Soviet Union", used until its dissolution in 1991, which was given new words and adopted by the Russian Federation in 2000 to replace an instrumental national anthem that had been introduced in 1990."Bro Gozh ma Zadoxc3xb9", the regional anthem of Brittany and, "Bro Goth Agan Tasow", the Cornish regional anthem, are sung to the same tune as that of the Welsh regional anthem "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau", with similar words. Some countries, such as the former Soviet Union, Spain, and the United Kingdom, among others, are held to be unions of several "nations" by various definitions.After the Soviet Union disbanded in the early 1990s, some of its former constituent states, now sovereign nations in their own right, retained the melodies of their old Soviet-era regional anthems until replacing them or, in some cases, still use them today.Unlike most national anthems, few of which were composed by renowned composers, the Soviet Union's various regional anthems were composed by some of the best Soviet composers, including world-renowned Gustav Ernesaks (Estonia), Aram Khachaturian (Armenia), Otar Taktakishvili (Georgia), and Uzeyir Hajibeyov (Azerbaijan).The lyrics present great similarities, all having mentions to Vladimir Lenin (and most, in their initial versions, to Joseph Stalin, the Armenian and Uzbek anthems being exceptions), to the guiding role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and to the brotherhood of the Soviet peoples, including a specific reference to the friendship of the Russian people (the Estonian, Georgian and Karelo-Finnish anthems were apparently an exception to this last rule).Some of the Soviet regional anthems' melodies can be sung in the Soviet Union anthem lyrics (Ukrainian and Belarus are the most fitted in this case).Most of these regional anthems were replaced with new national ones during or after the dissolution of the Soviet Union; Belarus, Kazakhstan (until 2006), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan (until 1997), and Uzbekistan kept the melodies, but with different lyrics.In 1865, the first three stanzas and later the first two officially became the national anthem of Greece and later also that of the Republic of Cyprus."Forged from the Love of Liberty" was composed as the national anthem for the short-lived West Indies Federation (1958xe2x80x931962) and was adopted by Trinidad and Tobago when it became independent in 1962."Esta xc3x89 a Nossa Pxc3xa1tria Bem Amada" is the national anthem of Guinea-Bissau and was also the national anthem of Cape Verde until 1996."Oben am jungen Rhein", national anthem of Liechtenstein is set to the tune of "God Save the Queen". </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This document was based on several years of consultation aimed to lay out the government's priorities for museums in the 21st century.The document listed the following as priorities for the next decade:# Museums will fulfil their potential as learning resources (pp 7xe2x80x9310).#* Museums will be embedded into the delivery of education in every school in the country.#* Understanding of the effectiveness of museum education will be improved further and best practice built into education programmes.#* The value of museums' collections as a research resource will be well understood and better links built between the academic community and museums.# Museums will embrace their role in fostering, exploring, celebrating and questioning the identities of diverse communities (pp 11xe2x80x9314).#* The sector needs to work with partners in academia and beyond to create an intellectual framework supporting museums' capacity to tackle issues of identity.#* The museum sector must continue to develop improved practical techniques for engaging communities of all sorts.# Museums' collections will be more dynamic and better used (pp 15xe2x80x9318).#* Government and the sector will find new ways to encourage museums to collect actively and strategically, especially the record of contemporary society.#* The sector will develop new collaborative approaches to sharing and developing collections and related expertise.# Museums' workforce will be dynamic, highly skilled and representative (pp 17xe2x80x9322).#* Museums' governing bodies and workforce will be representative of the communities they serve.#* Find more varied ways for a broader range of skills to come into museums.#* Improve continuing professional development.# Museums will work more closely with each other and partners outside the sector (pp 23xe2x80x9326).#* A consistent evidence base of the contribution of all kinds of museums to the full range of public service agendas will be developed.#* There will be deeper and longer lasting partnerships between the national museums and a broader range of regional partners.#* Museums' international roles will be strengthened to improve museum programmes in this country and Britain's image, reputation and relationships abroad.The conservation profession response to this report was on the whole less than favourable, the Institute of Conservation (ICON) published their response under the title "A Failure of Vision".Preservation Virginia, founded in Richmond in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.Today, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field, and within their area of specialization.These organizations exist to "support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage".This involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators, allied professionals, and the public.Image:St amant roche savine 3 (2).jpg|<center>First archaeological search in the 19th-century layer by French archaeologist and restorer Yves Morvan</center>Image:St amant roche savine 1 (2).jpg|<center>Painting of the 15th century cleared before restoration</center>Image:St amant roche savine 8.jpg|<center>Painting after restoration</center>;Scholarly journals;Relation to the publicExternal lists of international cultural heritage documents: 'However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation of cultural heritage.The University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an intern.Conservation of cultural heritage is an interdisciplinary field as conservators have backgrounds in the fine arts, sciences (including chemistry, biology, and materials science), and closely related disciplines, such as art history, archaeology, and anthropology. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> "In Chekhov's lifetime, British and Irish critics generally did not find his work pleasing; E. J. Dillon thought "the effect on the reader of Chekhov's tales was repulsion at the gallery of human waste represented by his fickle, spineless, drifting people" and R. E. C. Long said "Chekhov's characters were repugnant, and that Chekhov revelled in stripping the last rags of dignity from the human soul".One of the first non-Russians to praise Chekhov's plays was George Bernard Shaw, who subtitled his Heartbreak House "A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes," and pointed out similarities between the predicament of the British landed class and that of their Russian counterparts as depicted by Chekhov: "the same nice people, the same utter futility.In the first category were: Children, The Chorus Girl, A Play, Home, Misery, The Runaway, In Court, Vanka, Ladies, A Malefactor, The Boys, Darkness, Sleepy, The Helpmate, and The Darling; in the second: A Transgression, Sorrow, The Witch, Verochka, In a Strange Land, The Cook's Wedding, A Tedious Business, An Upheaval, Oh!Mikhail Chekhov, who recorded his brother's depression and restlessness after Nikolay's death, was researching prisons at the time as part of his law studies, and Anton Chekhov, in a search for purpose in his own life, himself soon became obsessed with the issue of prison reform.In 1890, Chekhov undertook an arduous journey by train, horse-drawn carriage, and river steamer to the Russian Far East and the katorga, or penal colony, on Sakhalin Island, north of Japan, where he spent three months interviewing thousands of convicts and settlers for a census. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In parallel, these enzymes activate proapoptotic procaspase-8, which does directly activate the mitochondrial events of apoptosis.# HIV may increase the level of cellular proteins that prompt Fas-mediated apoptosis.# HIV proteins decrease the amount of CD4 glycoprotein marker present on the cell membrane.# Released viral particles and proteins present in extracellular fluid are able to induce apoptosis in nearby "bystander" T helper cells.# HIV decreases the production of molecules involved in marking the cell for apoptosis, giving the virus time to replicate and continue releasing apoptotic agents and virions into the surrounding tissue.# The infected CD4+ cell may also receive the death signal from a cytotoxic T cell.Cells may also die as direct consequences of viral infections.b'      DESCRIPTION: Programmed cell death in multicellular organisms.{ }Apoptosis (from Ancient Greek xe1xbcx80xcfx80xcfx8cxcfx80xcfx84xcfx89xcfx83xcexb9xcfx82, apxc3xb3ptxc5x8dsis, "falling off") is a form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms.In contrast to necrosis, which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis is a highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism's life cycle.In fact, iodine and thyroxine also stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins in amphibians metamorphosis, and stimulate the evolution of their nervous system transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog.Negative regulation of apoptosis inhibits cell death signaling pathways, helping tumors to evade cell death and developing drug resistance. </my-abstract>

<title>Anal sex</title>
<wiki-abstract> Anal sex or anal intercourse is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure.See pages 270–271 for anal sex information, and page 118 for information about the clitoris. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, a condom can break or otherwise come off during anal sex, and this is more likely to happen with anal sex than with other sex acts because of the tightness of the anal sphincters during friction.Unprotected receptive anal sex (with an HIV positive partner) is the sex act most likely to result in HIV transmission.Although anal sex alone does not lead to pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity if the penis is near the vagina (such as during intercrural sex or other genital-genital rubbing) and its sperm is deposited near the vagina's entrance and travels along the vagina's lubricating fluids; the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.There are a variety of factors that make male-to-female anal intercourse riskier than vaginal intercourse for women, including the risk of HIV transmission being higher for anal intercourse than for vaginal intercourse.Pain during receptive anal sex among gay men (or men who have sex with men) is formally known as anodyspareunia.However, many gay men and men who have sex with men in general (those who identify as gay, bisexual, heterosexual or have not identified their sexual identity) do not engage in anal sex.Gay men who prefer anal sex may view it as their version of intercourse and a natural expression of intimacy that is capable of providing pleasure.Men who have sex with men may also prefer to engage in frot or other forms of mutual masturbation because they find it more pleasurable or more affectionate, to preserve technical virginity, or as safe sex alternatives to anal sex,Reports regarding the prevalence of anal sex among gay men and other men who have sex with men vary.The latter was allowed because anal intercourse was considered equivalent to vaginal intercourse in this way; men were said to "take it like a woman" (muliebria pati, "to undergo womanly things") when they were anally penetrated, but when a man performed anal sex on a woman, she was thought of as playing the boy's role.In Japan, records (including detailed shunga) show that some males engaged in penetrative anal intercourse with males.In many Western countries, anal sex has generally been taboo since the Middle Ages, when heretical movements were sometimes attacked by accusations that their members practiced anal sex among themselves.The term buggery originated in medieval Europe as an insult used to describe the rumored same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from a sect originating in Bulgaria, where its followers were called bogomils;The Renaissance poet Pietro Aretino advocated anal sex in his Sonetti Lussuriosi (Lust Sonnets).The Mishneh Torah, a text considered authoritative by Orthodox Jewish sects,Liwat, or the sin of Lot's people, which has come to be interpreted as referring generally to same-sex sexual activity, is commonly officially prohibited by Islamic sects; there are parts of the Quran which talk about smiting on Sodom and Gomorrah, and this is thought to be a reference to unnatural sex, and so there are hadith and Islamic laws which prohibit it.' </my-abstract>

the canton of Fricktal by the districts of Rheinfelden and Laufenburg (except for Hottwil which was transferred to that district in 2010).The chief magistracy of Aargau changed its style repeatedly:In the 17th century, Aargau was the only federal condominium where Jews were tolerated.There were 140,768 or 25.7% who were born in the same canton, while 136,865 or 25.0% were born somewhere else in Switzerland, and 107,396 or 19.6% were born outside of Switzerland., children and teenagers (0xe2x80x9319 years old) make up 24.3% of the population, while adults (20xe2x80x9364 years old) make up 62.3% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 13.4%., there were 227,656 people who were single and never married in the canton.Most of the region came under the control of the ducal house of Zxc3xa4hringen and the comital houses of Habsburg and Kyburg by about 1200.In the second half of the 13th century, the territory became divided between the territories claimed by the imperial cities of Bern, Lucerne and Solothurn and the Swiss canton of Unterwalden.The remaining portion, largely corresponding to the modern canton of Aargau, remained under the control of the Habsburgs until the "conquest of Aargau" by the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1415.Habsburg Castle itself, the original seat of the House of Habsburg, was taken by Bern in April 1415.The Habsburgs had founded a number of monasteries (with some structures enduring, e.g., in Wettingen and Muri), the closing of which by the government in 1841 was a contributing factor to the outbreak of the Swiss civil war xe2x80x93 the "Sonderbund War" xe2x80x93 in 1847.When Frederick IV of Habsburg sided with Antipope John XXIII at the Council of Constance, Emperor Sigismund placed him under the Imperial ban.</ref>}} In July 1414, the Pope visited Bern and received assurances from them, that they would move against the Habsburgs.Bern's portion of the Aargau came to be known as the Unteraargau, though can also be called the Berner or Bernese Aargau.As with most Swiss cantons there has been a trend since the early 2000s for municipalities to merge, though mergers in Aargau have so far been less radical than in other cantons.The blazon of the coat of arms is Per pale, dexter: sable, a fess wavy argent, charged with two cotises wavy azure; sinister: sky blue, three mullets of five argent.The flag and arms of the canton of Aargau date to 1803 and are an original design by Samuel Ringier-Seelmatter; the current official design, specifying the stars as five-pointed, dates to 1930.Aargau has a population (|lc=on}}) of . </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> His works commanded high prices although he never achieved the level of prestige of Jan Brueghel the Elder, the Antwerp master who contributed to the floral genre.His sons and his pupil and brother-in-law, Balthasar van der Ast, were among those to uphold the Bosschaert dynasty which continued until the mid-17th century.It may not be a coincidence that this trend coincided with a national obsession with exotic flowers which made flower portraits highly sought after.Although he was highly in demand, he did not create many pieces because he was also employed as an art dealer.' </my-abstract>

<title>Anthroposophy</title>
<wiki-abstract> Anthroposophy is a philosophy founded in the early 20th century by the esotericist Rudolf Steiner that postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible spiritual world, accessible to human experience. Followers of anthroposophy aim to develop mental faculties of spiritual discovery through a mode of thought independent of sensory experience. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> For Steiner, the human capacity for rational thought would allow individuals to comprehend spiritual research on their own and bypass the danger of dependency on an authority such as himself.Steiner contrasted the anthroposophical approach with both conventional mysticism, which he considered lacking the clarity necessary for exact knowledge, and natural science, which he considered arbitrarily limited to what can be seen, heard, or felt with the outward senses.In Theosophy, Steiner suggested that human beings unite a physical body of substances gathered from and returning to the inorganic world; a life body (also called the etheric body), in common with all living creatures (including plants); a bearer of sentience or consciousness (also called the astral body), in common with all animals; and the ego, which anchors the faculty of self-awareness unique to human beings.Anthroposophy describes a broad evolution of human consciousness.Steiner believed he had thus located the origin of free will in our thinking, and in particular in sense-free thinking.Some of the epistemic basis for Steiner's later anthroposophical work is contained in the seminal work, Philosophy of Freedom.Christian and Jewish mystical thought have also influenced the development of anthroposophy.Steiner believed in the possibility of applying the clarity of scientific thinking to spiritual experience, which he saw as deriving from an objectively existing spiritual world.Steiner's writing, though appreciative of all religions and cultural developments, emphasizes Western tradition as having evolved to meet contemporary needs.Thus, anthroposophy considers there to be a being who unifies all religions, and who is not represented by any particular religious faith.A number of these organizations are striving to foster positive relationships between the Arab and Jewish populations: The Harduf Waldorf school includes both Jewish and Arab faculty and students, and has extensive contact with the surrounding Arab communities, while the first joint Arab-Jewish kindergarten was a Waldorf program in Hilf near Haifa.Towards the end of Steiner's life, a group of theology students (primarily Lutheran, with some Roman Catholic members) approached Steiner for help in reviving Christianity, in particular "to bridge the widening gulf between modern science and the world of spirit".Anthroposophy's supporters include Pulitzer Prize-winning and Nobel Laureate Saul Bellow,The historian of religion Olav Hammer has termed anthroposophy "the most important esoteric society in European history.Hammer also asserts that the development of what she calls "fringe" sciences such as anthroposophic medicine and biodynamic agriculture are justified partly on the basis of the ethical and ecological values they promote, rather than purely on a scientific basis.Though Steiner saw that spiritual vision itself is difficult for others to achieve, he recommended open-mindedly exploring and rationally testing the results of such research; he also urged others to follow a spiritual training that would allow them directly to apply his methods to achieve comparable results.Anthony Storr stated about Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy: "His belief system is so eccentric, so unsupported by evidence, so manifestly bizarre, that rational skeptics are bound to consider it delusional.... </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Starting in the 1990s grazing and rewilding projects brought new impetus to the idea and new breeding-back efforts came underway, this time with the aim of recreating an animal not only with the looks, but also with the behaviour and the ecological impact of the aurochs, to be able to fill the ecological role of the aurochs.The drive behind reintroduction efforts of the aurochs is largely motivated by a belief that an aesthetically pleasing open park-like landscape is "natural".In the early 1920s, two German zoo directors (in Berlin and Munich), the brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck, began a selective breeding program to breed back the aurochs into existence from the descendant domesticated cattle.Domestic yak, gayal, and Bali cattle do not descend from aurochs.The first complete mitochondrial genome (16,338 base pairs) DNA sequence analysis of Bos primigenius from an archaeologically verified and exceptionally well preserved aurochs bone sample was published in 2010,A DNA study has also suggested that the modern European bison originally developed as a prehistoric cross-breed between the aurochs and the steppe bison.Three wild subspecies of aurochs are recognised.The species survived in Europe until 1627, when the last recorded aurochs died in the Jaktorxc3xb3w Forest, Poland.During the Neolithic Revolution, which occurred during the early Holocene, at least two aurochs domestication events occurred: one related to the Indian subspecies, leading to zebu cattle, and the other related to the Eurasian subspecies, leading to taurine cattle. </my-abstract>

<title>Asynchronous Transfer Mode</title>
<wiki-abstract> }} </wiki-abstract>

<headings> Protocol architecture , Cell structure , Service types ,  
A network must establish a connection before two parties can send cells to each other. In ATM this is called a virtual circuit (VC). It can be a permanent virtual circuit (PVC), which is created administratively on the end points, or a switched virtual circuit (SVC), which is created as needed by the communicating parties. SVC creation is managed by signaling, in which the requesting party indicates the address of the receiving party, the type of service requested, and whatever traffic parameters may be applicable to the selected service. "Call admission" is then performed by the network to confirm that the requested resources are available and that a route exists for the connection.
 , 
ATM operates as a channel-based transport layer, using VCs. This is encompassed in the concept of the virtual paths (VP) and virtual channels. Every ATM cell has an 8- or 12-bit virtual path identifier (VPI) and 16-bit virtual channel identifier (VCI) pair defined in its header. The VCI, together with the VPI, is used to identify the next destination of a cell as it passes through a series of ATM switches on its way to its destination. The length of the VPI varies according to whether the cell is sent on the user-network interface (on the edge of the network), or if it is sent on the network-network interface (inside the network).
As these cells traverse an ATM network, switching takes place by changing the VPI/VCI values (label swapping). Although the VPI/VCI values are not necessarily consistent from one end of the connection to the other, the concept of a circuit is consistent (unlike IP, where any given packet could get to its destination by a different route than the others). ATM switches use the VPI/VCI fields to identify the virtual channel link (VCL) of the next network that a cell needs to transit on its way to its final destination. The function of the VCI is similar to that of the data link connection identifier (DLCI) in frame relay and the logical channel number and logical channel group number in X.25.
Another advantage of the use of virtual circuits comes with the ability to use them as a multiplexing layer, allowing different services (such as voice, frame relay, n* 64 channels, IP). The VPI is useful for reducing the switching table of some virtual circuits which have common paths.
 , 
ATM can build virtual circuits and virtual paths either statically or dynamically. Static circuits (permanent virtual circuits or PVCs) or paths (permanent virtual paths or PVPs) require that the circuit is composed of a series of segments, one for each pair of interfaces through which it passes.
PVPs and PVCs, though conceptually simple, require significant effort in large networks. They also do not support the re-routing of service in the event of a failure. Dynamically built PVPs (soft PVPs or SPVPs) and PVCs (soft PVCs or SPVCs), in contrast, are built by specifying the characteristics of the circuit (the service "contract") and the two end points.
ATM networks create and remove switched virtual circuits (SVCs) on demand when requested by an end piece of equipment. One application for SVCs is to carry individual telephone calls when a network of telephone switches are inter-connected using ATM. SVCs were also used in attempts to replace local area networks with ATM.
 , 
Most ATM networks supporting SPVPs, SPVCs, and SVCs use the Private Network Node Interface or the Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) protocol to share topology information between switches and select a route through a network. PNNI is a link-state routing protocol like OSPF and IS-IS. PNNI also includes a very powerful route summarization mechanism to allow construction of very large networks, as well as a call admission control (CAC) algorithm which determines the availability of sufficient bandwidth on a proposed route through a network in order to satisfy the service requirements of a VC or VP.
 , 
Another key ATM concept involves the traffic contract. When an ATM circuit is set up each switch on the circuit is informed of the traffic class of the connection.
ATM traffic contracts form part of the mechanism by which "quality of service" (QoS) is ensured. There are four basic types (and several variants) which each have a set of parameters describing the connection.
# CBR - Constant bit rate: a Peak Cell Rate (PCR) is specified, which is constant.
# VBR - Variable bit rate: an average or Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR) is specified, which can peak at a certain level, a PCR, for a maximum interval before being problematic.
# ABR - Available bit rate: a minimum guaranteed rate is specified.
# UBR - Unspecified bit rate: traffic is allocated to all remaining transmission capacity.
VBR has real-time and non-real-time variants, and serves for "bursty" traffic. Non-real-time is sometimes abbreviated to vbr-nrt.
Most traffic classes also introduce the concept of Cell-delay variation tolerance (CDVT), which defines the "clumping" of cells in time.
 , 
To maintain network performance, networks may apply traffic policing to virtual circuits to limit them to their traffic contracts at the entry points to the network, i.e. the user–network interfaces (UNIs) and network-to-network interfaces (NNIs): usage/network parameter control (UPC and NPC). which is a version of the leaky bucket algorithm. CBR traffic will normally be policed to a PCR and CDVt alone, whereas VBR traffic will normally be policed using a dual leaky bucket controller to a PCR and CDVt and an SCR and Maximum Burst Size (MBS). The MBS will normally be the packet (SAR-SDU) size for the VBR VC in cells.
If the traffic on a virtual circuit is exceeding its traffic contract, as determined by the GCRA, the network can either drop the cells or mark the Cell Loss Priority (CLP) bit (to identify a cell as potentially redundant). Basic policing works on a cell by cell basis, but this is sub-optimal for encapsulated packet traffic (as discarding a single cell will invalidate the whole packet). As a result, schemes such as partial packet discard (PPD) and early packet discard (EPD) have been created that will discard a whole series of cells until the next packet starts. This reduces the number of useless cells in the network, saving bandwidth for full packets. EPD and PPD work with AAL5 connections as they use the end of packet marker: the ATM user-to-ATM user (AUU) indication bit in the payload-type field of the header, which is set in the last cell of a SAR-SDU.
 , 
Traffic shaping usually takes place in the network interface card (NIC) in user equipment, and attempts to ensure that the cell flow on a VC will meet its traffic contract, i.e. cells will not be dropped or reduced in priority at the UNI. Since the reference model given for traffic policing in the network is the GCRA, this algorithm is normally used for shaping as well, and single and dual leaky bucket implementations may be used as appropriate.
 , 
The ATM network reference model approximately maps to the three lowest layers of the OSI reference model. It specifies the following layers:
 , 
ATM became popular with telephone companies and many computer makers in the 1990s. However, even by the end of the decade, the better price/performance of Internet Protocol-based products was competing with ATM technology for integrating real-time and bursty network traffic.
 , 
Wireless ATM, There was a wireless ATM forum formed to standardize the technology behind wireless ATM networks. The forum was supported by several telecommunication companies, including NEC, Fujitsu and AT&T. Mobile ATM aimed to provide high speed multimedia communications technology, capable of delivering broadband mobile communications beyond that of GSM and WLANs.

<my-abstract> for its past medical indications, particularly for depression and chronic pain.Long-term amphetamine exposure at sufficiently high doses in some animal species is known to produce abnormal dopamine system development or nerve damage, Reviews of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that long-term treatment with amphetamine decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD, and improves function in several parts of the brain, such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia.Reviews of clinical stimulant research have established the safety and effectiveness of long-term continuous amphetamine use for the treatment of ADHD.<!--Topics to cover:Topics to cover:Amphetamine's MoA in the periphery:Amphetamine's MoA in the CNS:-->In 2015, a systematic review and a meta-analysis of high quality clinical trials found that, when used at low (therapeutic) doses, amphetamine produces modest yet unambiguous improvements in cognition, including working memory, long-term episodic memory, inhibitory control, and some aspects of attention, in normal healthy adults;According to the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), cardiovascular disease, severe agitation, or severe anxiety.According to the same review, there is at least one trial that shows antipsychotic medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.Many types of substances are known to interact with amphetamine, resulting in altered drug action or metabolism of amphetamine, the interacting substance, or both.In general, there is no significant interaction when consuming amphetamine with food, but the pH of gastrointestinal content and urine affects the absorption and excretion of amphetamine, respectively.Amphetamine exerts its behavioral effects by altering the use of monoamines as neuronal signals in the brain, primarily in catecholamine neurons in the reward and executive function pathways of the brain.Amphetamine has been identified as a potent full agonist of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a  and  G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) discovered in 2001, which is important for regulation of brain monoamines.The carbon atom adjacent to the primary amine is a stereogenic center, and amphetamine is composed of a racemic 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers.The substituted derivatives of amphetamine, or "substituted amphetamines", are a broad range of chemicals that contain amphetamine as a "backbone"; The class includes amphetamine itself, stimulants like methamphetamine, serotonergic empathogens like MDMA, and decongestants like ephedrine, among other subgroups.Since the first preparation was reported in 1887,A number of chiral resolutions have been developed to separate the two enantiomers of amphetamine.A significant number of amphetamine syntheses feature a reduction of a nitro, imine, oxime, or other nitrogen-containing functional groups. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The prototype first flew on 28 October 1972.The first twin-engine widebody airliner, the A300 typically seats 247 passengers in two classes over a range of 5,375 to 7,500& km (2,900 to 4,050& nmi).Initial variants are powered by CF6-50 or JT9D turbofans and have a three-crew flight deck.The improved A300-600 has a two-crew cockpit and updated GE CF6-80 or PW4000 engines, it made its first flight on 8 July 1983 and entered service later that year.The A300 is the basis of the smaller A310 (first flown in 1982) and was adapted in a freighter version.Its cross section was retained for the larger A340 (1991) and A330 (1992).It is also the basis for the oversize Beluga transport (1994).Launch customer Air France introduced the type on 23 May 1974.After limited demand initially, sales took off as the type was proven in early service, beginning three decades of steady orders.It has a similar capacity to the Boeing 767-300, introduced in 1986, but lacked the 767-300ER range.During the 1990s, the A300 became popular with cargo aircraft operators, as passenger airliner conversions or as original builds.Production ceased in July 2007 after 561 deliveries.During the 1960s, European aircraft manufacturers such as Hawker Siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation, based in the UK, and Sud Aviation of France, had ambitions to build a new 200-seat airliner for the growing civil aviation market.The FAA issues a single type rating which allows operation of both the A310 and A300-600.Airbus had demand for an aircraft smaller than the A300.On 7 July 1978, the A310 (initially the A300B10) was launched with orders from Swissair and Lufthansa.On 3 April 1982, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight and it received its type certification on 11 March 1983.Keeping the same eight-abreast cross-section, the A310 is  shorter than the initial A300 variants, and has a smaller  wing, down from .The A310 introduced a two-crew glass cockpit, later adopted for the A300-600 with a common type rating.It was powered by the same General Electric CF6-80 or Pratt & Whitney JT9D then PW4000 turbofans.It can seat 220 passengers in two classes, or 240 in all-economy, and can fly up to .It has overwing exits between the two main front and rear door pairs.In April 1983, the aircraft entered revenue service with Swissair and competed with the Boeing 767-200, introduced six months before.Its longer range and ETOPS regulations allowed it to be operated transatlantic flights.Until the last delivery in June 1998, 255 aircraft were produced, as it was succeeded by the larger Airbus A330-200.It has cargo aircraft versions, and was derived into the Airbus A310 MRTT military tanker/transport.Commonly referred to as the Airbus Beluga or "Airbus Super Transporter," these five airframes are used by Airbus to ferry parts between the company's disparate manufacturing facilities, thus enabling workshare distribution.Refinements made by Hawker Siddeley to the wing's design provided for greater lift and overall performance; this gave the aircraft the ability to climb faster and attain a level cruising altitude sooner than any other passenger aircraft.Perhaps the most significant change of the A300B was that it would not require new engines to be developed, being of a suitable size to be powered by Rolls-Royce's RB211, or alternatively the American Pratt & Whitney JT9D and General Electric CF6 powerplants; this switch was recognized as considerably reducing the project's development costs.On 10 April 1969, a few months after the decision to drop the RB207 had been announced, the British government announced that they would withdraw from the Airbus venture.On 29 May 1969, during the Paris Air Show, French transport minister Jean Chamant and German economics minister Karl Schiller signed an agreement officially launching the Airbus A300, the world's first twin-engine widebody airliner.In the aftermath of the Paris Air Show agreement, it was decided that, in order to provide effective management of responsibilities, a Groupement d'intxc3xa9rxc3xaat xc3xa9conomique would be established, allowing the various partners to work together on the project while remaining separate business entities.Airbus Industrie was initially headquartered in Paris, which is where design, development, flight testing, sales, marketing, and customer support activities were centered; the headquarters was relocated to Toulouse in January 1974.In September 1969, construction of the first prototype A300 began.On 15 March 1974, type certificates were granted for the A300 from both German and French authorities, clearing the way for its entry into revenue service.Another feature of later aircraft were the addition of wingtip fences, which generated greater aerodynamic performance (first introduced on the A310-300).In addition to passenger duties, the A300 became widely used by air freight operators; according to Airbus, it is the best selling freight aircraft of all time.On 23 May 1974, the first A300 to enter service performed the first commercial flight of the type, flying from Paris to London, for Air France.Immediately after the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favor the domestically made product& xe2x80x93 notably Air France and Lufthansa, the first two airlines to place orders for the type.During the flight testing of the A300B2, Airbus held a series of talks with Korean Air on the topic of developing a longer-range version of the A300, which would become the A300B4. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He was a brilliant orator and skilled parliamentary leader of the socialist opposition to the government of Tsar Nicholas II.During the 4th Session of the Fourth Duma in spring 1915, Kerensky appealed to Rodzianko with a request from the Council of elders to inform the Tsar that to succeed in war he must:1) change his domestic policy,2) proclaim a General Amnesty for political prisoners,3) restore the Constitution of Finland,4) declare the autonomy of Poland,5) provide national minorities autonomy in the field of culture,6) abolish restrictions against Jews,7) end religious intolerance,8) stop the harassment of legal trade union organizations.Kerensky was an active member of the irregular Freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia's Peoples,In response to bitter resentments held against the imperial favourite Grigori Rasputin in the midst of Russia's failing effort in World War I, Kerensky, at the opening of the Duma on 2 November 1916, called the imperial ministers "hired assassins" and "cowards", and alleged that they were "guided by the contemptible Grishka Rasputin!His arrest of Lavr Kornilov and other officers left him without strong allies against the Bolsheviks, who ended up being Kerensky's strongest and most determined adversaries, as opposed to the right wing, which evolved into the White movement.During the Kornilov Affair, Kerensky had distributed arms to the Petrograd workers, and by November most of these armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks.Kerensky escaped the Bolsheviks and fled to Pskov, where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to re-take the city. </my-abstract>

Certain veterans who served in Korea and are able to prove they were assigned to certain specified around the DMZ during a specific time frame are afforded similar presumption.The use of Agent Orange has been controversial in New Zealand, because of the exposure of New Zealand troops in Vietnam and because of the production of Agent Orange for Vietnam and other users at an Ivon Watkins-Dow chemical plant in Paritutu, New Plymouth.The Queensland health department determined that cancer rates in Innisfail were no higher than those in other parts of the state.The U.S. military, with the permission of the Canadian government, tested herbicides, including Agent Orange, in the forests near Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in New Brunswick.On February 17, 2011, the Toronto Star revealed that Agent Orange had been employed to clear extensive plots of Crown land in Northern Ontario.An analysis of chemicals present in the island's soil, together with resolutions passed by Guam's legislature, suggest that Agent Orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around Anderson Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Agana.Army armored personnel carrier (APC) spraying Agent Orange over Vietnamese rice fields during the Vietnam War.File:Defoliation agent spraying.jpg|A UH-1D helicopter from the 336th Aviation Company sprays a defoliation agent over farmland in the Mekong Delta.The government of Vietnam says that 4 million of its citizens were exposed to Agent Orange, and as many as 3 million have suffered illnesses because of it; these figures include their children who were exposed.According to a study by Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, children in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra fingers and toes."A declassified Department of Defense report written in 1973, suggests that there was a significant use of herbicides on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in Thailand to remove foliage that provided cover for enemy forces.The University of Hawaii has acknowledged extensive testing of Agent Orange on behalf of the United States Department of Defense in Hawaii along with mixtures of Agent Orange on Kaua'i Island in 1967xe2x80x9368 and on Hawaii Island in 1966; testing and storage in other U.S. locations has been documented by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.Agent Orange was sprayed on thousands of acres of brush in the Tennessee Valley for 15 years before scientists discovered the herbicide was dangerous. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The French body of administrative law is called "droit administratif".French administrative law, which is the founder of Continental administrative law, has a strong influence on administrative laws in several other countries such as Belgium, Greece, Turkey and Tunisia.In Germany  administrative law is called "Verwaltungsrecht" , which generally rules the relationship between authorities and the citizens.Administrative law expanded greatly during the twentieth century, as legislative bodies worldwide created more government agencies to regulate the social, economic and political spheres of human interaction.Civil law countries often have specialized administrative courts that review these decisions.Unlike most common-law jurisdictions, the majority of civil law jurisdictions have specialized courts or sections to deal with administrative cases which, as a rule, will apply procedural rules specifically designed for such cases and distinct from those applied in private-law proceedings, such as contract or tort claims.In Brazil, administrative cases are typically heard either by the Federal Courts (in matters concerning the Federal Union) or by the Public Treasury divisions of State Courts (in matters concerning the States).The General Administrative Procedure Law is under way.In France, most claims against the national or local governments as well as claims against private bodies providing public services [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&idTexte=CETATEXT000007634187 C.E, 31 juillet 1912, Socixc3xa9txc3xa9 des Granits Porphyroxc3xafdes des Vosges] and [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?idTexte=CETATEXT000007636499 C.E, Sect., 19 octobre 1956, Socixc3xa9txc3xa9 Le Bxc3xa9ton]</ref> are handled by administrative courts, which use the Conseil d'xc3x89tat (Council of State) as a court of last resort for both ordinary and special courts.[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?idTexte=CETATEXT000007636304 C.E, Ass., 7 fxc3xa9vrier 1947, Aillixc3xa8res] and [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?idTexte=CETATEXT000007637848 C.E, Ass., 12 juillet 1969, L'xc3x89tang]</ref> The main administrative courts are the tribunaux administratifs and appeal courts are the cours administratives d'appel. </my-abstract>

<title>Accounting</title>
<wiki-abstract> Accounting or accountancy is the measurement, processing, and communication of financial and non financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. Accounting, which has been called the "language of business", measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms.Accounting can be divided into several fields including financial accounting, management accounting, external auditing, tax accounting and cost accounting.Even though accounting has existed in various forms and levels of sophistication throughout many human societies, and the double-entry accounting system in use today was developed in medieval Europe, particularly in Venice, and is usually attributed to the Italian mathematician and Franciscan friar Luca Pacioli.The history of accounting is thousands of years old and can be traced to ancient civilizations.Double-entry bookkeeping was pioneered in the Jewish community of the early-medieval Middle East With the development of joint-stock companies, accounting split into financial accounting and management accounting.This branch of accounting was first formally introduced in the March 1976 issue of The Journal of Accountancy.Professional accounting bodies include the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the other 179 members of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), Many of these professional bodies offer education and training including qualification and administration for various accounting designations, such as certified public accountant (AICPA) and chartered accountant.Depending on its size, a company may be legally required to have their financial statements audited by a qualified auditor, and audits are usually carried out by accounting firms.Accounting firms grew in the United States and Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and through several mergers there were large international accounting firms by the mid-twentieth century. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the Argentine ant, pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, banded sugar ant, pharaoh ant, red ant, carpenter ant, odorous house ant, red imported fire ant, and European fire ant.The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.Parasitic ant species enter the colonies of host ants and establish themselves as social parasites; species such as Strumigenys xenos are entirely parasitic and do not have workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their Strumigenys perplexa hosts.Ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi.The ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials.Like all ants, they can also make use of visual landmarks when availableThese polarization detectors are sensitive in the ultraviolet region of the light spectrum.Not all ants have the same kind of societies.Sounds may be used to communicate with colony members or with other species.Ants attack and defend themselves by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid in the case of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants.The worker subsequently dies.Suicidal defences by workers are also noted in a Brazilian ant, Forelius pusillus, where a small group of ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.Many animals can learn behaviours by imitation, but ants may be the only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. </my-abstract>

<title>Arbitration in the United States</title>
<wiki-abstract> Arbitration, in the context of United States law, is a form of alternative dispute resolution. Specifically, arbitration is an alternative to litigation through which the parties to a dispute agree to submit their respective positions (through agreement or hearing) to a neutral third party (the arbitrator(s) or arbiter(s)) for resolution. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state legislatures to protect their consumers against powerful corporations.Since commercial arbitration is based upon either contract law or the law of treaties, the agreement between the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration is a legally binding contract.Labor arbitration comes in two varieties:#interest arbitration, which provides a method for resolving disputes about the terms to be included in a new contract when the parties are unable to agree, and#grievance arbitration, which provides a method for resolving disputes over the interpretation and application of a collective bargaining agreement.Arbitration has also been used as a means of resolving labor disputes for more than a century. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Tradition derives the name from Aegina, the mother of the hero Aeacus, who was born on the island and became its king.The municipality of Aegina consists of the island of Aegina and a few offshore islets.The Catalan Company seized control of Athens, and with it Aegina, in 1317, and in 1425 the island became controlled by the Venetians, when Alioto Caopena, at that time ruler of Aegina, placed himself by treaty under the Republic's protection to escape the danger of a Turkish raid.The fortifications too, were allowed to become decrepit and were inadequately guarded.After the end of the Duchy of Athens and the principality of Achaia, the only Latin possessions left on the mainland of Greece were the papal city of Monemvasia, the fortress of Vonitsa, the Messenian stations Coron and Modon, Lepanto, Pteleon, Navarino, and the castles of Argos and Nauplia, to which the island of Aegina was subordinate.In 1502xe2x80x9303, the new peace treaty left Venice with nothing but Cephalonia, Monemvasia and Nauplia, with their appurtenances in the Morea. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Macedonian phalanx of Aelian had many points of resemblance to the solid masses of pikemen and the squadrons of cavalry of the Spanish and Dutch systems, and the translations made in the 16th century formed the groundwork of numerous books on drill and tactics.The first significant reference to the influence of Aelian in the 16th century is a letter to Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange from his cousin William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg on December 8, 1594. </my-abstract>

<title>Agarose</title>
<wiki-abstract> Agarose is a polysaccharide, generally extracted from certain red seaweed. It is a linear polymer made up of the repeating unit of agarobiose, which is a disaccharide made up of D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactopyranose. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Agarose gels have lower resolving power for DNA than acrylamide gels, but they have greater range of separation, and are therefore usually used for DNA fragments with lengths of 50xe2x80x9320,000 bp (base pairs), although resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).The pore size of the gel affects the size of the DNA that can be sieved. </my-abstract>

<title>Atomic absorption spectroscopy</title>
<wiki-abstract> Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and atomic emission spectroscopy (AES)  is a spectroanalytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chemical elements using the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms in the gaseous state. Atomic absorption spectroscopy is based on absorption of light by free metallic ions. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> AAS can be used to determine over 70 different elements in solution, or directly in solid samples via electrothermal vaporization, and is used in pharmacology, biophysics,archaeology and toxicology research.Atomic emission spectroscopy was first used as an analytical technique, and the underlying principles were established in the second half of the 19th century by Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, both professors at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.Atomic absorption spectrometry has many uses in different areas of chemistry such as clinical analysis of metals in biological fluids and tissues such as whole blood, plasma, urine, saliva, brain tissue, liver, hair, muscle tissue,Atomic absorption spectrometry can use  in qualitative and quantitative analysis.The technique makes use of the atomic absorption spectrum of a sample in order to assess the concentration of specific analytes within it.The major components of this concept are atomization of the sample from a graphite platform inserted into the graphite tube (Lxe2x80x99vov platform) instead of from the tube wall in order to delay atomization until the gas phase in the atomizer has reached a stable temperature; use of a chemical modifier in order to stabilize the analyte to a pyrolysis temperature that is sufficient to remove the majority of the matrix components; and integration of the absorbance over the time of the transient absorption signal instead of using peak height absorbance for quantification.In ET AAS a transient signal is generated, the area of which is directly proportional to the mass of analyte (not its concentration) introduced into the graphite tube. </my-abstract>

<title>Affray</title>
<wiki-abstract> In many legal jurisdictions related to English common law, affray is a public order offence consisting of the fighting of one or more persons in a public place to the terror (in ) of ordinary people.  Depending on their actions, and the laws of the prevailing jurisdiction, those engaged in an affray may also render themselves liable to prosecution for assault, unlawful assembly, or riot; if so, it is for one of these offences that they are usually charged. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> It is created by section 3 of the Public Order Act 1986 which provides:}}The term "violence" is defined by section 8.Section 3(6) once provided that a constable could arrest without warrant anyone he reasonably suspected to be committing affray, but that subsection was repealed by paragraph 26(2) of Schedule 7 to, and Schedule 17 to, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which includes more general provisions for police to make arrests without warrant.The mens rea of affray is that person is guilty of affray only if he intends to use or threaten violence or is aware that his conduct may be violent or threaten violence.The offence of affray has been used by HM Government to address the problem of drunken or violent individuals who cause serious trouble on airliners.In R v Childs & Price (2015), the Court of Appeal quashed a murder verdict and replaced it with affray, having dismissed an allegation of common purpose.Affray is a serious offence for the purposes of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008.In New South Wales, section 93C of the Crimes Act of 1900 defines that a person will be guilty of affray if he or she threatens unlawful violence towards another and his or her conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety.In Queensland, section 72 of the Criminal Code of 1899The Indian Penal Code (sect. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The dispute did, however, witness an early manifestation of mass trade unionism amongst the miners of the valley and although unsuccessful the dispute saw the emergence of a stronger sense of solidarity amongst the miners.Steam coal was subsequently found in the Rhondda and further west, but many of the great companies of the Welsh coal industry's Gilded Age started operation in Aberdare and the lower Cynon Valley, including those of Samuel Thomas, David Davies and Sons, Nixon's Navigation and Powell Duffryn.During the early years of the twentieth century, the Aberdare valley became the focus of increased militancy among the mining workforce and an unofficial strike by 11,000 miners in the district from 20 October 1910 unyil 2 February 1911 attracted much attention at the time, although it was ultimately overshadowed by the Cambrian dispute in the neighbouring Rhondda valley which became synonymous with the so-called Tonypandy Riots.In common with the rest of the South Wales coalfield, Aberdare's coal industry commenced a long decline after World War I, and the last two deep mines still in operation in the 1960s were the small Aberaman and Fforchaman collieries, which closed in 1962 and 1965 respectively.On 11 May 1919, an extensive fire broke out on Cardiff Street, Aberdare.With the decline of both iron and coal, Aberdare has become reliant on commercial businesses as a major source of employment.Among the notable chapels were Calfaria, Aberdare and Seion, Cwmaman (Baptist); Saron, Aberaman and Siloa, Aberdare (Independent); and Bethania, Aberdare (Calvinistic Methodist).The earliest Welsh Independent, or Congregationalist chapel in the Aberdare area was Ebenezer, trecynon, although meetings had been held from the latter years of the eighteenth century in dwelling houses in the locality, for example at Hirwaun.The Baptists were the most influential of the nonconformist denominations in Aberdare and their development was led by the Rev.Now renamed as Aberdare Town They play in the Welsh League Division Two at Aberaman ParkAberdare Rugby Football Club are a rugby union team formed in 1890 which still play in Aberdare today at the Ynys Stadium.The Aberdare Athletic Ground was the venue of the first rugby league international, played between Wales and the New Zealand All Golds on New Year's Day 1908, which was won by the Welsh 9xe2x80x938.Notable current and former residents and natives of Aberdare include: 'The lack of a Free Library, however, remained a concern.Later, the formation of the Glamorgan County Council (upon which Aberdare had five elected members) in 1889, followed by the Aberdare Urban District Council, which replaced the Local Board in 1889, transformed the local politics of the Aberdare valley.At the 1889 Glamorgan County Council Elections most of the elected representatives were coalowners and industrialists and the only exception in the earlier period was the miners' agent David Morgan (Dai o'r Nant), elected in 1892 as a labour representative. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Thus the angle of the light in the Earth's frame in terms of the angle in the Sun's frame isIn the case of <math>theta = 90^circ</math>, this result reduces to <math>tan(theta - phi) = v/c</math>, which in the limit <math>v/c ll 1</math> may be approximated by <math>theta - phi = v/c</math>.The reasoning in the relativistic case is the same except that the relativistic velocity addition formulas must be used, which can be derived from Lorentz transformations between different frames of reference.The relativistic explanation is very similar to the classical one however, and in both theories aberration may be understood as a case of addition of velocities.In the Sun's frame, consider a beam of light with velocity equal to the speed of light c, with x and y velocity components <math>u_x</math> and <math>u_y</math>, and thus at an angle xcexb8 such that <math>tan(theta) = u_y/u_x</math>.If the Earth is moving at velocity <math>v</math> in the x direction relative to the Sun, then by velocity addition the x component of the beam's velocity in the Earth's frame of reference is <math>u_x' = u_x + v</math>, and the y velocity is unchanged, <math>u_y' = u_y</math>.Due to orbital eccentricity, the orbital velocity <math>v</math> of Earth (in the Sun's rest frame) varies periodically during the year as the planet traverses its elliptic orbit and consequently the aberration also varies periodically, typically causing stars to appear to move in small ellipses.Approximating Earth's orbit as circular, the maximum displacement of a star due to annual aberration is known as the constant of aberration, conventionally represented by <math>kappa</math>. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The radial polynomials <math>R^m_n</math> have no azimuthal dependence, and are defined asand <math>R^m_n(rho)=0</math> if <math>n-m</math> is odd.The first few Zernike polynomials, multiplied by their respective fitting coefficients, are:where <math>rho</math> is the normalized pupil radius with <math>0 le rho le 1</math>, <math>phi</math> is the azimuthal angle around the pupil with <math>0 le phi le 2pi</math>, and the fitting coefficients <math>a_0,ldots,a_8</math> are the wavefront errors in wavelengths.As in Fourier synthesis using sines and cosines, a wavefront may be perfectly represented by a sufficiently large number of higher-order Zernike polynomials.In all earlier kinds of glass, however, the dispersive power increased with the refractive index; that is, <math>v</math> decreased as <math>n</math> increased; but some of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott were crown glasses of high refractive index, and achromatic systems from such crown glasses, with flint glasses of lower refractive index, are called the new achromats, and were employed by P. Rudolph in the first anastigmats (photographic objectives).Instead of making <math>df</math> vanish, a certain value can be assigned to it which will produce, by the addition of the two lenses, any desired chromatic deviation, e.g.The analytical approximation theory is often employed provisionally, since its accuracy does not generally suffice.In order to render spherical aberration and the deviation from the sine condition small throughout the whole aperture, there is given to a ray with a finite angle of aperture u* (width infinitely distant objects: with a finite height of incidence h*) the same distance of intersection, and the same sine ratio as to one neighboring the axis (u* or h* may not be much smaller than the largest aperture U or H to be used in the system). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b"      { }Abersychan is a settlement and community north of Pontypool in Torfaen, Wales, and lies within the boundaries of the historic county of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent.Abersychan lies in the narrow northern section of the Afon Lwyd valley.The town includes two schools; Abersychan Comprehensive School and Victoria Primary School; together with various shops and other amenities including Abersychan Rugby Club.Abersychan was the birthplace of the politicians Roy Jenkins, Don Touhig and Paul Murphy (MP for Torfaen); and of the rugby footballers Wilfred Hodder, Candy Evans and Bryn Meredith.Like many of the 17th century isolated agricultural hamlets in the forested South Wales Valleys, Abersychan became a thriving industrial centre in the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly for iron production.After the discovery of iron stone locally, the principal ironworks were built by the British Iron Company in 1825, served mainly by the LNWR's Brynmawr and Blaenavon Railway. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The autocorrelation matrix is used in various digital signal processing algorithms.For a random vector <math>mathbf{X} = (X_1,ldots,X_n)^{rm T}</math> containing random elements whose expected value and variance exist, the auto-correlation matrix is defined by{{Equation box 1where <math>{}^{rm T}</math> denotes transposition and has dimensions <math>n times n</math>.Written component-wise:begin{bmatrix}operatorname{E}[X_1 X_1] & operatorname{E}[X_1 X_2] & cdots & operatorname{E}[X_1 X_n]  operatorname{E}[X_2 X_1] & operatorname{E}[X_2 X_2] & cdots & operatorname{E}[X_2 X_n]   vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots  operatorname{E}[X_n X_1] & operatorname{E}[X_n X_2] & cdots & operatorname{E}[X_n X_n]  end{bmatrix}If <math>mathbf{Z}</math> is a complex random vector, the autocorrelation matrix is instead defined byHere <math>{}^{rm H}</math> denotes Hermitian transposition.For example, if <math>mathbf{X} = left( X_1,X_2,X_3 right)^{rm T}</math> is a random vectors, then <math>operatorname{R}_{mathbf{X}mathbf{X}}</math> is a <math>3 times 3</math> matrix whose <math>(i,j)</math>-th entry is <math>operatorname{E}[X_i X_j]</math>.In signal processing, the above definition is often used without the normalization, that is, without subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance.engineering) the normalization is usually dropped and the terms "autocorrelation" and "autocovariance" are used interchangeably.The definition of the auto-correlation coefficient of a stochastic process isIf the function <math>rho_{XX}</math> is well-defined, its value must lie in the range <math>[-1,1]</math>, with 1 indicating perfect correlation and xe2x88x921 indicating perfect anti-correlation.For a weak-sense stationarity, wide-sense stationarity (WSS) process, the definition iswhereThe normalization is important both because the interpretation of the autocorrelation as a correlation provides a scale-free measure of the strength of statistical dependence, and because the normalization has an effect on the statistical properties of the estimated autocorrelations.The fact that the auto-correlation function <math>operatorname{R}_{XX}</math> is an even function can be stated asRespectively for a WSS process:For a WSS process:Notice that <math>operatorname{R}_{XX}(0)</math> is always real.The Cauchyxe2x80x93Schwarz inequality, inequality for stochastic processes:The autocorrelation of a continuous-time white noise signal will have a strong peak (represented by a Dirac delta function) at <math>tau=0</math> and will be exactly 0 for all other <math>tau</math>.The Wienerxe2x80x93Khinchin theorem relates the autocorrelation function <math>operatorname{R}_{XX}</math> to the power spectral density <math>S_{XX}</math> via the Fourier transform:For real-valued functions, the symmetric autocorrelation function has a real symmetric transform, so the Wienerxe2x80x93Khinchin theorem can be re-expressed in terms of real cosines only:The auto-correlation matrix (also called second moment) of a random vector <math>mathbf{X} = (X_1,ldots,X_n)^{rm T}</math> is an <math>n times n</math> matrix containing as elements the autocorrelations of all pairs of elements of the random vector <math>mathbf{X}</math>.<math>x_0=2, x_1=3, x_2=-1</math>, and <math>x_i = 0</math> for all other values of ) by hand, we first recognize that the definition just given is the same as the "usual" multiplication, but with right shifts, where each vertical addition gives the autocorrelation for particular lag values:       & 2 & 3 & -1 times & 2 & 3 & -1 hline       &-2 &-3 & 1        &   & 6 & 9 & -3      + &   &   & 4 & 6 & -2 hline       & -2 & 3 &14 & 3 & -2end{array}</math>Thus the required autocorrelation sequence is <math>R_{xx}=(-2,3,14,3,-2)</math>, where <math>R_{xx}(0)=14,</math> <math>R_{xx}(-1)= R_{xx}(1)=3,</math> and <math>R_{xx}(-2)= R_{xx}(2) = -2,</math> the autocorrelation for other lag values being zero.Note that the expectation may not be well defined.Subtracting the mean before multiplication yields the auto-covariance function between times <math>t_1</math> and <math>t_2</math>:{{Equation box 1Note that this expression is not well-defined for all-time series or processes, because the mean may not exist, or the variance may be zero (for a constant process) or infinite (for processes with distribution lacking well-behaved moments, such as certain types of power law).If <math>left{ X_t right}</math> is a wide-sense stationary process then the mean <math>mu</math> and the variance <math>sigma^2</math> are time-independent, and further the autocovariance function depends only on the lag between <math>t_1</math> and <math>t_2</math>: the autocovariance depends only on the time-distance between the pair of values but not on their position in time.When the autocorrelation function is normalized by mean and variance, it is sometimes referred to as the autocorrelation coefficient or autocovariance function.Given a signal <math>f(t)</math>, the continuous autocorrelation <math>R_{ff}(tau)</math> is most often defined as the continuous cross-correlation integral of

<my-abstract> Among the most famous of these are the Seville Fair or Feria de Abril in Seville, now echoed by smaller fairs in Madrid and Barcelona, both of which have many Andalusian immigrants; the Feria de Agosto in Mxc3xa1laga; the Feria de Jerez or Feria del Caballo in Jerez; the Festival of Corpus Christi in Granada; the Feria de Nuestra Sexc3xb1ora de la Salud in Cxc3xb3rdoba; the Columbian Festivals (Fiestas Colombinas) in Huelva; the Feria de la Virgen del Mar in Almerxc3xada; and the Feria de San Lucas in Jaxc3xa9n, among many others.Festivals of a religious nature are a deep Andalusian tradition and are met with great popular fervor.In Spanish they are:Festival de cine europeo de Sevilla,Festival Internacional de Cortometrajes Almerxc3xada en Corto,Festival de Cine Iberoamericano de Huelva,Muestra Cinematogrxc3xa1fica del Atlxc3xa1ntico Alcances,Festival de cine y televisixc3xb3n de Islantilla,Festival de Cine Africano de Tarifa.All have articles in es-wiki.Both of these roads run generally eastxe2x80x93west, although the Autovxc3xada A-4 turns to the south in western Andalusia.Other first-order roads include the Autovxc3xada A-48 roughly along the Atlantic coast from Cxc3xa1diz to Algeciras, continuing European route E05 to meet up with European route E15; the Autovxc3xada del Quinto Centenario (Autovxc3xada A-49), which continues west from Seville (where the Autovxc3xada A-4 turns toward the south) and goes on to Huelva and into Portugal as European route E01; the Autovxc3xada Ruta de la Plata (Autovxc3xada A-66), European route E803, which roughly corresponds to the ancient Roman 'Silver Route' from the mines of northern Spain, and runs north from Seville; the Autovxc3xada de Mxc3xa1laga (Autovxc3xada A-45), which runs south from Cxc3xb3rdoba to Mxc3xa1laga; and the Autovxc3xada de Sierra Nevada (Autovxc3xada A-44), part of European route E902, which runs south from Jaxc3xa9n to the Mediterranean coast at Motril.As of 2008 Andalusia has six public airports, all of which can legally handle international flights.In 1528 Francisco Delicado wrote La lozana andaluza, a novel in the orbit of La Celestina, and in 1599 the Sevillian Mateo Alemxc3xa1n wrote the first part of Guzmxc3xa1n de Alfarache, the first picaresque novel with a known author.The prominent humanist literary school of Seville included such writers as Juan de Mal Lara, Fernando de Herrera, Gutierre de Cetina, Luis Barahona de Soto, Juan de la Cueva, Gonzalo Argote de Molina, and Rodrigo Caro.Malaga is also located part of the private Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection at Carmen Thyssen Museum.There are numerous other significant museums around the region, both of paintings and of archeological artifacts such as gold jewelry, pottery and other ceramics, and other works that demonstrate the region's artisanal traditions.The Council of Government has designated the following "Municipios Turxc3xadsticos": in Almerxc3xada, Roquetas de Mar; in Cxc3xa1diz, Chiclana de la Frontera, Chipiona, Conil de la Frontera, Grazalema, Rota, and Tarifa; in Granada, Almuxc3xb1xc3xa9car; in Huelva, Aracena; in Jaxc3xa9n, Cazorla; in Mxc3xa1laga, Benalmxc3xa1dena, Fuengirola, Nerja, Rincxc3xb3n de la Victoria, Ronda, and Torremolinos; in Seville, Santiponce.The unemployment rate stood at 25.5% in 2017 and was one of the highest in Spain and Europe.In urban transport, underdeveloped public transport systems put pedestrian traffic and other non-motorized traffic are at a disadvantage compared to the use of private vehicles.The lyrics appeal to the Andalusians to mobilise and demand tierra y libertad ("land and liberty") by way of agrarian reform and a statute of autonomy within Spain.The Parliament of Andalusia voted unanimously in 1983 that the preamble to the Statute of Autonomy recognise Blas Infante as the Father of the Andalusian Nation (Padre de la Patria Andaluza),The national holiday, the Dxc3xada de Andalucxc3xada, is celebrated on 28 February,The honorific title of Hijo Predilecto de Andalucxc3xada ("Favourite Son of Andalucia") is granted by the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to those whose exceptional merits benefited Andalusia, for work or achievements in natural, social, or political science.That article was set out for regions like Andalusia that had been prevented by the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War from adopting a statute of autonomy during the period of the Second Spanish Republic.Article 1 of the 1981 Statute of Autonomy justifies autonomy based on the region's "historical identity, on the self-government that the Constitution permits every nationality, on outright equality to the rest of the nationalities and regions that compose Spain, and with a power that emanates from the Andalusian Constitution and people, reflected in its Statute of Autonomy".In October 2006 the constitutional commission of the Cortes Generales (the national legislature of Spain), with favorable votes from the left-of-center Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), the leftist United Left (IU) and the right-of-center People's Party (PP), approved a new Statute of Autonomy for Andalusia, whose preamble refers to the community as a "national reality" (realidad nacional):On 2 November 2006 the Spanish Chamber Deputies ratified the text of the Constitutional Commission with 306 votes in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions.An annual pilgrimage brings a million visitors to the Hermitage of El Rocxc3xado in Almonte (population 16,914 in 2008); similarly large crowds visit the Santuario de Nuestra Sexc3xb1ora de la Cabeza in Andxc3xbajar every April.Other important festivals are the Carnival of Cxc3xa1diz and the Fiesta de las Cruces or Cruz de mayo in Granada and Cxc3xb3rdoba; in Cxc3xb3rdoba this is combined with a competition for among the patios (courtyards) of the city.Andalusia hosts an annual festival for the dance of flamenco in the summer-time.The Andalusian diet varies, especially between the coast and the interior, but in general is a Mediterranean diet based on olive oil, cereals, legumes, vegetables, fish, dried fruits and nuts, and meat; there is also a great tradition of drinking wine.Fried fishxe2x80x94pescaxc3xadto fritoxe2x80x94and seafood are common on the coast and also eaten well into the interior under coastal influence. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Manufacturers are also required to print '"with sweetener(s)" on the label close to the main product name on foods that contain "sweeteners such as aspartame" or "with sugar and sweetener(s)" on "foods that contain both sugar and sweetener".Phenylalanine is one of the essential amino acids and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life.Reviews have found no association between aspartame and cancer.Numerous allegations have been made via the Internet and in consumer magazines purporting neurotoxic effects of aspartame leading to neurological or psychiatric symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and mood changes.Comprehensive reviews have not found any evidence for aspartame as a cause for these symptoms.Headaches are the most common symptom reported by consumers.The perceived sweetness of aspartame (and other sweet substances like acesulfame K) in humans is due to its binding of the heterodimer G protein-coupled receptor formed by the proteins TAS1R2 and TAS1R3.These reviews have found that even the high levels of intake of aspartame, studied across multiple countries and different methods of measuring aspartame consumption, are well below the ADI for safe consumption of aspartame.In a report released on 10 December 2013, the EFSA said that, after an extensive examination of evidence, it ruled out the "potential risk of aspartame causing damage to genes and inducing cancer," and deemed the amount found in diet sodas safe to consume.In 1975, prompted by issues regarding Flagyl and Aldactone, a U.S. FDA task force team reviewed 25 studies submitted by the manufacturer, including 11 on aspartame. </my-abstract>

<title>Asexual reproduction</title>
<wiki-abstract> Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction that does not involve the fusion of gametes or change in the number of chromosomes.  The offspring that arise by asexual reproduction from a single cell or from a multicellular organism inherit the genes of that parent. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> There is evidence to suggest that asexual reproduction has allowed the animals to evolve new proteins through the Meselson effect that have allowed them to survive better in periods of dehydration.Molecular evidence strongly suggests that several species of the stick insect genus Timema have used only asexual (parthenogenetic) reproduction for millions of years, the longest period known for any insect.In the grass thrips genus Aptinothrips there have been several transitions to asexuality, likely due to different causes.A complete lack of sexual reproduction is relatively rare among multicellular organisms, particularly animals.Many multicellular animals, plants and fungi can also reproduce asexually.While all prokaryotes reproduce without the formation and fusion of gametes, mechanisms for lateral gene transfer such as conjugation, transformation and transduction can be likened to sexual reproduction in the sense of genetic recombination in meiosis.Prokaryotes (Archaea and Bacteria) reproduce asexually through binary fission, in which the parent organism divides in two to produce two genetically identical daughter organisms. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The number of potential isomers increases rapidly with additional carbon atoms. Ethylene (ethene), showing the pi bond in green.Like a single covalent bond, double bonds can be described in terms of overlapping atomic orbitals, except that, unlike a single bond (which consists of a single sigma bond), a carbonxe2x80x93carbon double bond consists of one sigma bond and one pi bond.Otherwise:# Number the carbons in that chain starting from the end that is closest to the double bond.# Define the location k of the double bond as being the number of its first carbon.# Name the side groups (other than hydrogen) according to the appropriate rules.# Define the position of each side group as the number of the chain carbon it is attached to.# Write the position and name of each side group.# Write the names of the alkane with the same chain, replacing the "-ane" suffix by "k-ene".The position of the double bond is often inserted before the name of the chain (e.g.This double bond is stronger than a single covalent bond (611& kJ/mol for C=C vs. 347& kJ/mol for Cxe2x80x93C) and also shorter, with an average bond length of 1.33 xc3xa5ngstrxc3xb6ms (133 pm).Each carbon of the double bond uses its three sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals to form sigma bonds to three atoms (the other carbon and two hydrogen atoms).The decoloration of a solution of bromine in water is an analytical test for the presence of alkenes:Related reactions are also used as quantitative measures of unsaturation, expressed as the bromine number and iodine number of a compound or mixture.Hydrohalogenation is the addition of hydrogen halides, such as HCl or HI, to alkenes to yield the corresponding haloalkanes:If the two carbon atoms at the double bond are linked to a different number of hydrogen atoms, the halogen is found preferentially at the carbon with fewer hydrogen substituents.This reaction and the ozonolysis can be used to determine the position of a double bond in an unknown alkene.The oxidation can be stopped at the vicinal diol rather than full cleavage of the alkene by using osmium tetroxide or other oxidants:This reaction is called dihydroxylation.In the presence of an appropriate photosensitiser, such as methylene blue and light, alkenes can undergo reaction with reactive oxygen species generated by the photosensitiser, such as hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen or superoxide ion. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as blockage is dose-dependent, so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.The combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone.Close monitoring of potassium levels is required in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors who are at risk of hyperkalemia.Another possible adverse effect specific for ACE inhibitors, but not for other RAAS blockers, is an increase in bradykinin level.A persistent dry cough is a relatively common adverse effect believed to be associated with the increases in bradykinin levels produced by ACE inhibitors, although the role of bradykinin in producing these symptoms has been disputed.Later, they were found useful for other cardiovascular and kidney diseases including:In 2012, there was a meta-analysis published in the BMJ that described the protective role of ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of pneumonia when compared to ARBs (Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers).ACE inhibitors may also be used to help decrease excessive water consumption in people with schizophrenia resulting in psychogenic polydipsia.Additionally ACEi are commonly used after renal transplant to manage post-transplant erythrocytosis, a condition characterised by a persistently high hematocrit greater than 51% which often develops 8-24 months after successful transplantation,Common side effects include: low blood pressure, cough, hyperkalemia, headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and kidney impairment. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This evolved into the standard ATA interface for ease of cross-compatibility, though the sound card ATA interface still usually supported only a single CD-ROM and not hard drives.This second ATA interface on the sound card eventually evolved into the second motherboard ATA interface which was long included as a standard component in all PCs.Called the "primary" and "secondary" ATA interfaces, they were assigned to base addresses 0x1F0 and 0x170 on ISA bus systems.-->In 1994, about the same time that the ATA-1 standard was adopted, Western Digital introduced drives under a newer name, Enhanced IDE (EIDE).This is more appropriate since the two devices have always operated, since the earliest ATA specification, as equal peers on the cable, with neither having control or priority over the other.It is a common myth that the controller on the device 0 drive assumes control over the device 1 drive, or that the device 0 drive may claim priority of communication over the other device on the same ATA interface.The host adapter grounds this pin; if a device sees that the pin is grounded, it becomes the Device 0 device; if it sees that pin 28 is open, the device becomes the Device 1 device.This setting is usually chosen by a jumper setting on the drive called "cable select", usually marked CS, which is separate from the Device 0/1 setting.Note that if two drives are configured as Device 0 and Device 1 manually, this configuration does not need to correspond to their position on the cable.This pin's socket on the female connector is often obstructed, requiring pin 20 to be omitted from the male cable or drive connector; it is thus impossible to plug it in the wrong way round.However, some flash memory drives can use pin 20 as VCC_in to power the drive without requiring a special power cable; this feature can only be used if the equipment supports this use of pin 20.; Pin 28Pin 28 of the gray (slave/middle) connector of an 80-conductor cable is not attached to any conductor of the cable.The exception to this is when the CF device is connected to a 44-pin ATA bus designed for 2.5-inch hard disk drives, commonly found in notebook computers, as this bus implementation must provide power to a standard hard disk drive.CF devices can be designated as devices 0 or 1 on an ATA interface, though since most CF devices offer only a single socket, it is not necessary to offer this selection to end users. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The four left Atari, disgruntled over Warner's oversight of the company and treatment of programmers, and formed Activision, which introduced third-party software to the VCS.The VCS was the best-selling console during the 1979 holiday season, with more than 1 million units sold, but Atari saw new competition from the Mattel Intellivision and Magnavox Odysseyxc2xb2, which also used ROM cartridges.In 1982, Atari launched its second home console, which it named the Atari 5200; to standardize its naming, the VCS was renamed to the "Atari 2600 Video Computer System", or "Atari 2600" for short, derived from the manufacture part number CX2600.The console implements the original 2600 architecture and can be modified to play original 2600 cartridges by adding a cartridge port, and is also compatible with original 2600 controllers.In 2017, Hyperkin announced the RetroN 77, a clone of the Atari 2600 that plays original cartridges instead of pre-installed games.The Atari VCS microconsole, planned for release from Atari Interactive by 2019, is designed on a miniaturization of the Atari 2600, including the option for its faux wood paneling.Coupled with the oversaturated home game market, Atari's weakened position led investors to start pulling funds out of video games, beginning a cascade of effects known as the video game crash of 1983.In September 1983, Atari sent 14 truckloads of unsold Atari 2600 cartridges and other equipment to a landfill in the New Mexico desert, later labeled the Atari video game burial.The North American video game market did not recover until about 1986, after Nintendo had introduced the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> These aired for most of 1995, but did not sell the remaining stock of Jaguar systems.In a 1995 interview with Next Generation, then-CEO Sam Tramiel declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the newly launched Sega Saturn, and slightly weaker than the upcoming PlayStation.In Atari's 1995 annual report, it noted:  In addition, Atari had severely limited financial resources, and so could not create the level of marketing which has historically backed successful gaming consoles.By November 1995, mass layoffs and insider statements were fueling journalistic speculation that Atari had ceased both development and manufacturing for the Jaguar and was simply trying to sell off existing stock before exiting the video game industry.In its 10-K405 SEC Filing, filed April 12, 1996, Atari informed their stockholders that its revenues had declined by more than half, from $38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995, then gave them the news on the truly dire nature of the Jaguar:The filing confirmed that Atari had given up on the Jaguar in November of 1995 and in the subsequent months were concerned chiefly with liquidating its inventory of Jaguar products.After the Atari/JTS merger, the bulk of the remaining Jaguar inventory remained unsold;From the Jaguar Software Reference manual, page 1: In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic due to the greater developer familiarity with the 68000 and the adequacy of the 68000 for certain types of games.It was developed by Jeff Minter, who had created the program after experimenting with graphics during the development of Tempest 2000.An additional accessory for the Jaguar CD, which allowed Jaguar CD games to save persistent data such as preferences and saved games, was also released.A virtual reality headset compatible with the console, tentatively titled the Jaguar VR, was unveiled by Atari at the 1995 Winter Consumer Electronics Show. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> After this essay was circulated in samizdat and then published outside the Soviet Union, Sakharov was banned from conducting any military-related research and returned to FIAN to study fundamental theoretical physics.Over the next twelve years, until his exile to Gorky (Nizhny Novgorod) in January 1980, Andrei Sakharov assumed the role of a widely recognized and open dissident in Moscow.In 1970 Sakharov was among the three founding members of the Committee on Human Rights in the USSR along with Valery Chalidze and Andrei Tverdokhlebov.Sakharov married a fellow human rights activist, Yelena Bonner, in 1972.By 1973 Sakharov was meeting regularly with Western correspondents, holding press conferences in his apartment.In 1972 Sakharov became the target of sustained pressure from his fellow scientists in the USSR Academy of Sciences, the Soviet press.She had heart surgery in the United States and returned to Gorky in June 1986.In December 1985, the European Parliament established the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, to be given annually for outstanding contributions to human rights.On 19 December 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev, who had initiated the policies of perestroika and glasnost, called Sakharov to tell him that he and his wife could return to Moscow.In 1988, Sakharov was given the International Humanist Award by the International Humanist and Ethical Union.Soon after 21:00 on 14 December 1989, Sakharov went to his study to take a nap before preparing an important speech he was to deliver the next day in the Congress. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Some Theory of Everything will explain why the various features of the Universe must have exactly the values that we see.# The multiverse: Multiple universes exist, having all possible combinations of characteristics, and we inevitably find ourselves within a universe that allows us to exist.# Intelligent design: A creator designed the Universe with the purpose of supporting complexity and the emergence of intelligence.# The life principle: There is an underlying principle that constrains the Universe to evolve towards life and mind.# The self-explaining universe: A closed explanatory or causal loop: "perhaps only universes with a capacity for consciousness can exist".The anthropic principle is often criticized for lacking falsifiability and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, "conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist",In 1961, Robert Dicke noted that the age of the universe, as seen by living observers, cannot be random.Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, Sober (2005) argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design.Paul Davies's book The Goldilocks Enigma (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:# The absurd universe: Our universe just happens to be the way it is.# The unique universe: There is a deep underlying unity in physics that necessitates the Universe being the way it is. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A domain controller is contacted when a user logs into a device, accesses another device across the network, or runs a line-of-business Metro-style app sideloaded into a device.Other Active Directory services (excluding LDS, as described below) as well as most of Microsoft server technologies rely on or use Domain Services; examples include Group Policy, Encrypting File System, BitLocker, Domain Name Services, Remote Desktop Services, Exchange Server and SharePoint Server.The self-managed AD DS must not be confused with managed Azure AD DS, which is a cloud product.Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), formerly known as Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM),AD CS requires an AD DS infrastructure.Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a single sign-on service.Windows Server 2003 added a third main table for security descriptor single instancing.Programs may access the features of Active Directory via the COM interfaces provided by Active Directory Service Interfaces.[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa772170%28VS.85%29.aspx Active Directory Service Interfaces], Microsoft</ref>To allow users in one domain to access resources in another, Active Directory uses trusts.Trusts inside a forest are automatically created when domains are created.Backup and restore of Active Directory is possible for a network with a single domain controller,Certain Microsoft products such as SQL Server and so forth to support the various server roles.Physical hardware costs for the many separate servers can be reduced through the use of virtualization, although for proper failover protection, Microsoft recommends not running multiple virtualized domain controllers on the same physical hardware.The Active-Directory database, the directory store, in Windows 2000 Server uses the JET Blue-based Extensible Storage Engine (ESE98) and is limited to 16 terabytes and 2 billion objects (but only 1 billion security principals) in each domain controller's database.They provide essential features for a more convenient administration processes, such as automation, reports, integration with other services, etc.Varying levels of interoperability with Active Directory can be achieved on most Unix-like operating systems (including Unix, Linux, Mac OS X or Java and Unix-based programs) through standards-compliant LDAP clients, but these systems usually do not interpret many attributes associated with Windows components, such as Group Policy and support for one-way trusts.Third parties offer Active Directory integration for Unix-like platforms, including:The schema additions shipped with Windows Server 2003 R2 include attributes that map closely enough to RFC 2307 to be generally usable. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> While the greatest players of the time, among them Alekhine, Emanuel Lasker and Capablanca, clearly did not allow their play to be hobbled by blind adherence to general concepts that the center had to be controlled by pawns, that development had to happen in support of this control, that rooks always belong on open files, that wing openings were unsoundxe2x80x94core ideas of Tarrasch's chess philosophy as popularly understoodxe2x80x94beginners were taught to think of these generalizations as unalterable principles.Nimzowitsch supplemented many of the earlier simplistic assumptions about chess strategy by enunciating in his turn a further number of general concepts of defensive play aimed at achieving one's own goals by preventing realization of the opponent's plans. </my-abstract>

The definite article in Aragonese has undergone dialect-related changes,  with definite articles in Old Aragonese similar to their present Spanish equivalents. There are two main forms:
 
These forms are used in the eastern and some central dialects.
These forms are used in the western and some central dialects.
Neighboring Romance languages have influenced Aragonese. Catalan and Occitan influenced Aragonese for many years. Since the 15th century, Spanish has most influenced Aragonese; it was adopted throughout Aragon as the first language, limiting Aragonese to the northern region surrounding the Pyrenees. French has also influenced Aragonese; Italian loanwords have entered through other languages (such as Catalan), and Portuguese words have entered through Spanish. Germanic words came with the conquest of the region by Germanic peoples during the fifth century, and English has introduced a number of new words into the language.
 , 
Words that were part of the Latin second declension—as well as words that joined it later on—are usually masculine:
Words that were part of the Latin first declension are usually feminine:
Some Latin neuter plural nouns joined the first declension as singular feminine nouns: 
Words ending in -or are feminine:
The names of fruit trees usually end in -era (a suffix derived from Latin -ARIA) and are usually feminine:
The genders of river names vary:
 , 
Just like most other Occitano-Romance languages, Aragonese has partitive and locative clitic pronouns derived from the Latin inde and ibi: en/ne and bi/i/ie; unlike Ibero-Romance.
Such pronouns are present in most major Romance languages (Catalan en and hi, Occitan ne and i, French en and y, and Italian ne and ci/vi).
En/ne is used for:
Bi/hi/ie is used for:
 , 
Aragonese was not written until the 12th and 13th centuries; the history Liber Regum, there is also an Aragonese version of the Chronicle of Morea, differing also in its content and written in the late 14th century called  Libro de los fechos et conquistas del principado de la Morea.
 , 
Since 1500, Spanish was the cultural language of Aragon; many Aragonese wrote in Spanish, and during the 17th century the Argensola brothers went to Castile to teach Spanish. Following this, Aragonese lessons started in schools in the academic year 1997/98.

<my-abstract> A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, transonic if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), supersonic when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and hypersonic when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound.Additionally, Bernoulli's equation is a solution in one dimension to both the momentum and energy conservation equations.The ideal gas law or another such equation of state is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.Aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow, including flow speed, compressibility, and viscosity.Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.Understanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field)  enables the calculation of forces and moments acting on the object. </my-abstract>

<title>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</title>
<wiki-abstract> A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792), written by the 18th-century British proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who believed that women should not receive a rational education. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> "In attempting to navigate the cultural expectations of female writers and the generic conventions of political and philosophical discourse, Wollstonecraft, as she does throughout her oeuvre, constructs a unique blend of masculine and feminine styles in the Rights of Woman.Although Wollstonecraft argues against excessive sensibility, the rhetoric of the Rights of Woman is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader.When it was first published in 1792, the Rights of Woman was reviewed favourably by the Analytical Review, the General Magazine, the Literary Magazine, New York Magazine, and the Monthly Review, although the assumption persists even today that Rights of Woman received hostile reviews.Although female conservatives such as Hannah More excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they actually shared many of the same values.This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels Mary: A Fiction (1788) and Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman.As part of her argument that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises that they should not be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings.Claudia Johnson, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, has called the Rights of Woman "a republican manifesto".In the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft adheres to a version of republicanism that includes a belief in the eventual overthrow of all titles, including the monarchy. </my-abstract>

dotvarphi sintheta,mathbf{hat{boldsymboltheta}} ).However, if the particle's trajectory lies in a single plane, it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a scalar (more precisely, a pseudoscalar).angular momentum <math>L</math> is proportional to moment of inertia <math>I</math> and angular speed <math>omega</math> measured in radians per second.Because <math>I = r^2m</math> for a single particle and <math>omega = frac{v}{r}</math> for circular motion, angular momentum can be expanded, <math>L = r^2 m cdot frac{v}{r},</math> and reduced to,the product of the radius of rotation <math>r</math> and the linear momentum of the particle <math>p = mv</math>, where <math>v</math> in this case is the equivalent linear (tangential) speed at the radius (<math>= romega</math>).This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is perpendicular to the radius vector is considered.In vector notation, the orbital angular momentum of a point particle in motion about the origin can be expressed as:whereThis can be expanded, reduced, and by the rules of vector algebra, rearranged:  mathbf{L} &= left(r^2mright)left(frac{mathbf{r}timesmathbf{v}}{r^2}right)              &= mleft(mathbf{r}timesmathbf{v}right)              &= mathbf{r}times mmathbf{v}              &= mathbf{r}timesmathbf{p},end{align}</math>which is the cross product of the position vector <math>mathbf{r}</math> and the linear momentum <math>mathbf{p} = mmathbf{v}</math> of the particle.Ordinarily, the Lagrangian depends on the angular velocity through the kinetic energy: The latter can be written by separating the velocity to its radial and tangential part, with the tangential part at the x-y plane, around the z-axis, being equal to:where the subscript i stands for the i-th body, and m, v stand for mass, tangential velocity around the z-axis and angular velocity around that axis, respectively.For a body that is not point-like, with density &rho;, we have instead:where I is the moment of inertia around the z-axis.Thus, assuming the potential energy does not depend on  &omega; (this assumption may fail for electromagnetic systems), we have the angular momentum of the i-th object:We have thus far rotated each object by a separate angle; we may also define an overall angle &theta; by which we rotate the whole system, thus rotating also each object around the z-axis, and have the overall angular momentum:From Euler-Lagrange equations it then follows that:Since the lagrangian is dependent upon the angles of the object only through the potential, we have:which is the torque on the i-th object.Suppose the system is invariant to rotations, so that the potential is independent of an overall rotation by the angle &theta; (thus it may depend on the angles of objects only through their differences, in the form <math>V({theta_z}_i, {theta_z}_j) = V({theta_z}_i - {theta_z}_j)</math>).In Cartesian coordinates:  mathbf{L} &= left(xp_y - yp_xright)mathbf{e}_x wedge mathbf{e}_y + left(yp_z - zp_yright)mathbf{e}_y wedge mathbf{e}_z + left(zp_x - xp_zright)mathbf{e}_z wedge mathbf{e}_x             &= L_{xy}mathbf{e}_x wedge mathbf{e}_y + L_{yz}mathbf{e}_y wedge mathbf{e}_z + L_{zx}mathbf{e}_z wedge mathbf{e}_x ,,end{align}</math>or more compactly in index notation:The angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor, with components xcfx89.For example, the structure of electron shells and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.Quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by Niels Bohr in his Bohr model of the atom and was later predicted by Erwin Schrxc3xb6dinger in his Schrxc3xb6dinger equation.In the definition <math>mathbf{L}=mathbf{r}timesmathbf{p}</math>, six operators are involved: The position operators <math>r_x</math>, <math>r_y</math>, <math>r_z</math>, and the momentum operators <math>p_x</math>, <math>p_y</math>, <math>p_z</math>.This equation also appears in the geometric algebra formalism, in which L and xcfx89 are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them.In relativistic mechanics, the relativistic angular momentum of a particle is expressed as an antisymmetric tensor of second order:in the language of four-vectors, namely the four position X and the four momentum P, and absorbs the above L together with the motion of the centre of mass of the particle.In each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the centre of mass is for the system.Angular momentum in quantum mechanics differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in classical mechanics. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The first was the law of conservation of mass, closely associated with the work of Antoine Lavoisier, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the reactants have the same mass as the products).John Dalton studied and expanded upon this previous work and defended a new idea, later known as the law of multiple proportions: if the same two elements can be combined to form a number of different compounds, then the ratios of the masses of the two elements in their various compounds will be represented by small whole numbers.The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of neutrons in 1932.In 1917 Rutherford bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha particles and observed hydrogen nuclei being emitted from the gas (Rutherford recognized these, because he had previously obtained them bombarding hydrogen with alpha particles, and observing hydrogen nuclei in the products). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The next day, her role as State Counsellor was established.As soon as she became foreign minister, she invited Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Canadian Foreign Minister Stephane Dion and Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni in April and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in May and discussed to have good diplomatic relationships with these countries.Her tenure as State Counsellor of Myanmar has drawn international criticism for her failure to address her country's economic and ethnic problems, particularly the plight of the Rohingya following the 25 August 2017 ARSA attacks (described as "certainly one of the biggest refugee crises and cases of ethnic cleansing since the second world war"), for the weakening of freedom of the press and for her style of leadership, described as imperious and "distracted and out of touch".In 2017, critics have called for Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the persecution of Rohingya people in Myanmar.Some activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the 2012 Rakhine State riotsIn a 2015 BBC News article, reporter Jonah Fisher suggested that Aung San Suu Kyi's silence over the Rohingya issue is due to a need to obtain support from the majority Bamar ethnicity as she is in "the middle of a general election campaign".In 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims during the 2016xe2x80x9317 persecution.In October 2017, Oxford City Council announced that, following a unanimous cross-party vote,In March 2018, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum revoked Suu Kyi's Elie Wiesel Award, awarded in 2012, citing her failure "to condemn and stop the military's brutal campaign" against Rohingya Muslims.In May 2018, Aung San Suu Kyi was considered complicit in the crimes against Rohingyas in a report by Britain's International Development Committee.In August 2018, it was revealed that Aung San Suu Kyi would be stripped of her Freedom of Edinburgh award over her refusal to speak out against the crimes committed against the Rohingya.This sentence was commuted by the military rulers to further house arrest of 18 months.Vietnam, however, did not support calls by other ASEAN member states for Myanmar to free Aung San Suu Kyi, state media reported Friday, 14 August 2009.Nobel Peace Prize winners (Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, Shirin Ebadi, Adolfo Pxc3xa9rez Esquivel, Mairead Corrigan, Rigoberta Menchxc3xba, Prof. Elie Wiesel, US President Barack Obama, Betty Williams, Jody Williams and former US President Jimmy Carter) called for the rulers of Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi to "create the necessary conditions for a genuine dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all concerned parties and ethnic groups to achieve an inclusive national reconciliation with the direct support of the United Nations".It was announced prior to the 2010 Burmese general election that Aung San Suu Kyi may be released "so she can organize her party",US President Barack Obama personally advocated the release of all political prisoners, especially Aung San Suu Kyi, during the US-ASEAN Summit of 2009.In a personal letter to Aung San Suu Kyi, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown cautioned the Burmese government of the potential consequences of rigging elections as "condemning Burma to more years of diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation".Her son Kim Aris was granted a visa in November 2010 to see his mother shortly after her release, for the first time in 10 years.On 21 December 2011, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra met Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangoon, marking Aung San Suu Kyi's "first-ever meeting with the leader of a foreign country".In December 2011, there was speculation that Aung San Suu Kyi would run in the 2012 national by-elections to fill vacant seats.In an official campaign speech broadcast on Burmese state television's MRTV on 14 March 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi publicly campaigned for reform of the 2008 Constitution, removal of restrictive laws, more adequate protections for people's democratic rights, and establishment of an independent judiciary.On 1 April 2012, the NLD announced that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the vote for a seat in Parliament."The media were also prevented from visiting Aung San Suu Kyi, as occurred in 1998 when journalist Maurizio Giuliano, after photographing her, was stopped by customs officials who then confiscated all his films, tapes and some notes.The Burmese government detained and kept Aung San Suu Kyi imprisoned because it viewed her as someone "likely to undermine the community peace and stability" of the country, and used both Article 10(a) and 10(b) of the 1975 State Protection Act (granting the government the power to imprison people for up to five years without a trial), the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.The results from the UN facilitation have been mixed; Razali Ismail, UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Skywriting is a notable example.A new advertising approach is known as advanced advertising, which is data-driven advertising, using large quantities of data, precise measuring tools and precise targeting.Increasingly, other media are overtaking many of the "traditional" media such as television, radio and newspaper because of a shift toward the usage of the Internet for news and music as well as devices like digital video recorders (DVRs) such as TiVo.Online advertising began with unsolicited bulk e-mail advertising known as "e-mail spam".Examples of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on search engine results pages, banner ads, in pay per click text ads, rich media ads, Social network advertising, online classified advertising, advertising networks and e-mail marketing, including e-mail spam.As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, specialty channels emerged, including channels entirely devoted to advertising, such as QVC, Home Shopping Network, and ShopTV Canada.With the advent of the ad server, online advertising grew, contributing to the "dot-com" boom of the 1990s.Guerrilla marketing involves unusual approaches such as staged encounters in public places, giveaways of products such as cars that are covered with brand messages, and interactive advertising where the viewer can respond to become part of the advertising message.Advertising may also help to  reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful.Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, "Madison Avenue" advertising.Worldwide spending on advertising in 2015 amounted to an estimated billion|link=yes}}.In Latin, advertere means "to turn towards".In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the Classic of Poetry (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell confectionery.The purpose of advertising is to inform the consumers about their product and convince customers that a company's services or products are the best, enhance the image of the company, point out and create a need for products or services, demonstrate new uses for established products, announce new products and programs, reinforce the salespeople's individual messages, draw customers to the business, and to hold existing customers.There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the Ancient Near East in the field of astronomy, demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the "Aryans" (Indo-Europeans) over the Semites.Since the 19th century, numerous scholars have sought to use archaeoastronomical calculations to demonstrate the antiquity of Ancient Indian Vedic culture, computing the dates of astronomical observations ambiguously described in ancient poetry to as early as 4000 BC.More recently Gallagher,Archaeoastronomy is sometimes related to the fringe discipline of Archaeocryptography, when its followers attempt to find underlying mathematical orders beneath the proportions, size, and placement of archaeoastronomical sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramid of Kukulcxc3xa1n at Chichen Itza.There are currently three academic organisations for scholars of archaeoastronomy.While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.Euan MacKie has supported Thom's analysis, to which he added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization to argue for a stratified society in this period.In contrast Clive Ruggles has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom's surveys.In contrast to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of green archaeoastronomy, brown archaeoastronomy has been identified as being closer to the history of astronomy or to cultural history, insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual.One famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is Chichen Itza.Some of their works are considered precursors of archaeoastronomy; antiquarians interpreted the astronomical orientation of the ruins that dotted the English countryside as William Stukeley did of Stonehenge in 1740,The term archaeoastronomy was first used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973, would place the origin even later, stating: "...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of Alexander Thom in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s".Early archaeoastronomers surveyed Megalithic constructs in the British Isles, at sites like Auglish in [[County Londonderry, in an attempt to find statistical patterns.Clive Ruggles notes:The pyramids of GizaSince the first modern measurements of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations.Some have argued that the pyramids were laid out as a map of the three stars in the belt of Orion, The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular hierophany which occurs at the summer solstice, when the Sun, viewed from the Sphinx terrace, formsxe2x80x94together with the two giant pyramidsxe2x80x94the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid.Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with historical astronomy, the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the history of astronomy, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The magnetic field around the wire carrying current to be measured deflects the moving magnet.Since the ammeter shunt has a very low resistance, mistakenly wiring the ammeter in parallel with a voltage source will cause a short circuit, at best blowing a fuse, possibly damaging the instrument and wiring, and exposing an observer to injury.In AC circuits, a current transformer converts the magnetic field around a conductor into a small AC current, typically either  or  at full rated current, that can be easily read by a meter. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Examples include imipramine, doxepin, amitriptyline, nortriptyline and desipramine.Mirtazapine has demonstrated anxiolytic effects with a better side effect profile to all other classes of antidepressants, yet this is disputed by evidence that withdrawal is comparatively more severe than SSRI's, it is far more dangerous in overdose, it has a higher risk of causing life-threatening agrangulocytosis, it has more potential for adverse drug-drug interactions, and some find it noticeably sedating.It rarely causes or exacerbates anxiety, is sometimes particularly advantageous in certain individuals, with certain variants of depression, anxiety, or both, and its effectiveness tends to occur significantly faster than SSRIs.In many countries (such as USA and Australia), it is not specifically approved for anxiety disorders, being selected as an antidepressant when anxiety is co-occurring, or used off label.The drug is used in Canada, the UK and Australia.Sympatholytics are a group of anti-hypertensives which inhibit activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and several medications within this group have shown anxiolytic effects as well as potential therapy for PTSD.Although not officially approved for this purpose, beta blockers also can have an antianxiety effect.The alpha1 antagonist prazosin could be effective for PTSDThe Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists clonidine and guanfacine have demonstrated both anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects.Phenibut (brand names Anvifen, Fenibut, Noofen) is an anxiolyticMebicar (mebicarum) is an anxiolytic produced in Latvia and used in Eastern Europe.b"      { }An anxiolytic (also antipanic or antianxiety agent)Beta-receptor blockers such as propranolol and oxprenolol, although not anxiolytics, can be used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety such as tachycardia and palpitations.Anxiolytics are also known as minor tranquilizers.There are concerns that some GABAergics, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, may have an anxiogenic effect if used over long periods of time.Barbiturates exert an anxiolytic effect linked to the sedation they cause. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A recent randomized controlled trial, however, found no benefit over placebo and recommended that the use of antipsychotics in this way should no longer be regarded as an acceptable routine treatment.In 2005, a US government body, the National Institute of Mental Health published the results of a major independent study (the CATIE project).Generally, more than one antipsychotic drug should not be used at a time because of increased adverse effects., which citesVery rarely antipsychotics may cause tardive psychosis.Rare/Uncommon (<1% incidence for most antipsychotic drugs) adverse effects of antipsychotics include:Some studies have found decreased life expectancy associated with the use of antipsychotics, and argued that more studies are needed.Loss of grey matter and other brain structural changes over time are observed amongst people diagnosed with schizophrenia.In the subsequent 5 years, the use of atypical antipsychotics to treat dementia decreased by nearly 50%.A number of atypical antipsychotics have some benefits when used in addition to other treatments in major depressive disorder.Besides the above uses antipsychotics may be used for obsessivexe2x80x93compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, Tourette syndrome, autism and agitation in those with dementia.In children they may be used in those with disruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders and pervasive developmental disorders or intellectual disability.Aggressive challenging behavior in adults with intellectual disability is often treated with antipsychotic drugs despite lack of an evidence base.A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that grey matter loss is greater in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics relative to those treated with atypicals, and hypothesized a protective effect of atypicals as one possible explanation.Subtle, long-lasting forms of akathisia are often overlooked or confused with post-psychotic depression, in particular when they lack the extrapyramidal aspect that psychiatrists have been taught to expect when looking for signs of akathisia.The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.Tardive dyskinesia may abate during withdrawal from the antipsychotic agent, or it may persist.Withdrawal effects may also occur when switching a person from one antipsychotic to another, (it is presumed due to variations of potency and receptor activity). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It is typically combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (such as omeprazole) and a macrolide antibiotic (such as clarithromycin); other drug combinations are also effective.Amoxicillin is effective for treatment of early cutaneous Lyme borreliosis; the effectiveness and safety of oral amoxicillin is neither better nor worse than common alternatively-used antibiotics.Amoxicillin is occasionally used for the treatment of skin infections,Amoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child.Amoxicillin in combination with gentamicin is recommended for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option.It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent Streptococcus pneumoniae and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.It is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, xcexb2-lactam antibiotic in the aminopenicillin family used to treat susceptible Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. </my-abstract>

<title>Amorphous solid</title>
<wiki-abstract> In condensed matter physics and materials science, an amorphous (from the Greek a, without, morphé, shape, form) or non-crystalline solid is a solid that lacks the long-range order that is characteristic of a crystal. In some older books, the term has been used synonymously with glass. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> In discussing the style of her fantasy works, Le Guin herself said that in fantasy it was necessary to be clear and direct with language, because there is no known framework for the reader's mind to rest upon.The story often appears to assume that readers are familiar with the geography and history of Earthsea, a technique which allowed Le Guin to avoid exposition: a reviewer wrote that this method "gives Le Guin's world the mysterious depths of Tolkien's, but without his tiresome back-stories and versifying".Le Guin wrote five subsequent books that are collectively referred to as the Earthsea Cycle, together with A Wizard of Earthsea: The Tombs of Atuan (1971), The Farthest Shore (1972), Tehanu (1990), The Other Wind (2001), and Tales from Earthsea (2001).The image shown here depicts Ged sailing in his boat Lookfar, and was used in the 10th chapter, "The Open Sea", in which Ged and Vetch travel from Iffish eastward past all known lands to confront the shadow creature.A Wizard of Earthsea was first published in 1968 by Parnassus Press in Berkeley, a year before The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's watershed work. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Diana, her Roman equivalent, was especially worshipped on the Aventine Hill in Rome, near Lake Nemi in the Alban Hills, and in Campania.The name Artemis (noun, feminine) is of unknown or uncertain etymology, Georgios Babiniotis, while accepting that the etymology is unknown, also states that the name is already attested in Mycenean Greek and is possibly of Pre-Greek origin.The name may be possibly related to Greek xc3xa1rktos "bear" (from PIE *hxe2x82x82xc5x95xccxa5txe1xb8xb1os), supported by the bear cult the goddess had in Attica (Brauronia) and the Neolithic remains at the Arkoudiotissa Cave, as well as the story of Callisto, which was originally about Artemis (Arcadian epithet kallisto);According to J. T. Jablonski, the name is also Phrygian and could be "compared with the royal appellation Artemas of Xenophon.An aspect of the Taurian Artemis was also worshipped as Aricina.Pausanias at the Description of Greece writes that near Pyrrhichus there was a sanctuary of Artemis, called Astrateias (), with image of the goddess said to have been dedicated by the Amazons.One of the epithets of Artemis was Chitone ().Syracusans had a dance sacred to the Chitone Artemis.Artemis was born on the sixth day, which made it sacred for her.An important aspect of Artemis' persona and worship was her virginity, which may seem contradictory given her role as a goddess associated with childbirth.Hera was angry with her husband Zeus because he had impregnated Leto but the island of Delos disobeyed Hera and Leto gave birth there.According to the Homeric Hymn to Artemis the island where Leto gave birth was Ortygia.In ancient Cretan history Leto was worshipped at Phaistos and, in Cretan mythology, Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis on the islands known today as Paximadia.A scholium of Servius on Aeneid iii.Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her ten wishes:# to always remain a virgin# to have many names to set her apart from her brother Phoebus (Apollo)# to have a bow and arrow made by the Cyclopes# to be the Phaesporia or Light Bringer# to have a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt# to have sixty "daughters of Okeanos", all nine years of age, to be her choir# to have twenty Amnisides Nymphs as handmaidens to watch her dogs and bow while she rested# to rule all the mountains# any city# to have the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.Charles Anthon argued that the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from *arta, *art, *arte, all meaning "great, excellent, holy", thus Artemis "becomes identical with the great mother of Nature, even as she was worshipped at Ephesus".Ancient Greek writers, by way of folk etymology, and some modern scholars, have linked Artemis (Doric Artamis) to xe1xbcx84xcfx81xcfx84xcexb1xcexbcxcexbfxcfx82, artamos, i.e. </my-abstract>

Other notable groups are "Opgezwolle" (consisting of rapper Sticky Steez, rapper Phreaco Rico and DJ Delic) and Brainpower.There were two styles dominating the Dutch hip hop landscape: Extince, known for his easy flows, catchy songs and funky tunes, while hardcore performers like Westklan and Osdorp Posse found their own niche group of fans.In the mid-1990s The Postmen were topping the charts with their rap/reggae mix.In the early 2000s the MC fronted band Relax got much airplay, as did de Spookrijders.A combination of these two styles gave birth to de Spookrijders, a three-man hip-hop group founded in 1996.The rhythms are influenced by the American rap scene, and the lyrics are often about crime, drugs, money, women and other criminal things.Often coming from Dutch ghettos, lyrics often include themes occurring in these areas.Dutch gangsta hip hop mostly comes from the five largest  cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Den Haag, Utrecht and Eindhoven.The commercial success of Dutch hip hop is largely made by Brainpower, Yes-R, Ali B, Lange Frans & Baas B and Extince. </my-abstract>

<title>Ackermann function</title>
<wiki-abstract> In computability theory, the Ackermann function, named after Wilhelm Ackermann, is one of the simplest  and earliest-discovered examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Buck based an intuitive two-variable variant (F ) on the hyperoperation sequence: Compared to most other versions Buck's function has no unessential offsets:begin{array}{lr}operatorname{F}(0,n) = 2[0]n = n + 1 operatorname{F}(1,n) = 2[1]n = 2 + n operatorname{F}(2,n) = 2[2]n = 2 times n operatorname{F}(3,n) = 2[3]n = 2 ^ n operatorname{F}(4,n) = 2[4]n = 2^{2^{2^{{}^{.,^{.,^{.,^2}}}}}} ...end{array}Ackermann's original three-argument function <math>varphi(m, n, p)</math> is defined recursively as follows for nonnegative integers m, n, and p:begin{array}{lr}varphi(m, n, 0) = m + n varphi(m, 0, 1) = 0 varphi(m, 0, 2) = 1 varphi(m, 0, p) = m text{ for } p > 2 varphi(m, n, p) = varphi(m, varphi(m, n-1, p), p - 1) text{ for } n > 0 text{ and } p > 0.end{array}Of the various two-argument versions, the one developed by Pxc3xa9ter and Robinson (called "the" Ackermann function by some authors) is defined for nonnegative integers m and n as follows:begin{array}{lcl}operatorname{A}(0, n) & = & n + 1 operatorname{A}(m+1, 0) & = & operatorname{A}(m, 1) operatorname{A}(m+1, n+1) & = & operatorname{A}(m, A(m+1, n))end{array}It may not be immediately obvious that the evaluation of <math> A(m, n)</math> always terminates.This extreme growth can be exploited to show that f, which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a Turing machine and so is a computable function, grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive.In a category with exponentials, using the isomorphism <math>((X times Y) rightarrow Z) cong (X rightarrow (Y rightarrow Z))</math> (in computer science, this is called currying), the Ackermann function may be defined via primitive recursion over higher-order functionals as follows:begin{array}{lcl}operatorname{Ack}(0) & = & operatorname{S} operatorname{Ack}(m+1) & = & operatorname{Iter}(operatorname{Ack}(m))end{array}where  n + 1}} is the usual successor function and Iter denotes the functional power operator, defined by primitive recursion as well:begin{array}{lcl}operatorname{Iter}(f)(0) & = & f(1) operatorname{Iter}(f)(n+1) & = & f(operatorname{Iter}(f)(n)).end{array}The function <math>mathrm{Ack}</math> defined in this way agrees with the Ackermann function <math>A</math> defined above: <math>mathrm{Ack}(m)(n)=A(m,n)</math>.To see how the Ackermann function grows so quickly, it helps to expand out some simple expressions using the rules in the original definition.However, when m decreases there is no upper bound on how much n can increasexe2x80x94and it will often increase greatly.The Pxc3xa9ter-Ackermann function can also be expressed in relation to various other versions of the Ackermann function:   A(m,n) =   begin{cases}    0[m]n & text{, if }m=0     2[m](n+3) - 3 & text{, if }m>0    end{cases} </math>   A(m,n) =   begin{cases}    0uparrow^{m-2} n & text{, if }m=0     2uparrow^{m-2} (n+3) - 3 & text{, if }m>0    end{cases} </math>For small values of m like 1, 2, or 3, the Ackermann function grows relatively slowly with respect to n (at most exponentially).One common version, the two-argument Ackermannxe2x80x93Pxc3xa9ter function, is defined as follows for nonnegative integers m and n:begin{array}{lcl}operatorname{A}(0, n) & = & n + 1 operatorname{A}(m+1, 0) & = & operatorname{A}(m, 1) operatorname{A}(m+1, n+1) & = & operatorname{A}(m, operatorname{A}(m+1, n))end{array}Its value grows rapidly, even for small inputs. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However the Arbxc3xabreshxc3xab people from Southern Italy were the first Albanian people to arrive in the New World, many of them migrating after the wars that accompanied the Risorgimento.Since then several Albanian migration waves have occurred throughout the 20th century as for instance after the Second World War with Albanians mostly from Yugoslavia rather than from Communist Albania, then after the Breakup of Communist Albania in 1990 and finally following the Kosovo War in 1998.The most sizeable Albanian population in the Americas is predominantly to be found in the United States.The Albanian Renaissance proved crucial to the emancipation of the modern Albanian culture and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of literature and arts whereas artists sought to return to the ideals of Impressionism and Romanticism.The roots of literature of the Albanian people can be traced to the Middle Ages with surviving works about history, theology and philosophy dating from the Renaissance.In the 17th century and onwards, important contributions were made by the Arbxc3xabreshxc3xab people of Southern Italy who played an influential role in encouraging the Albanian Renaissance.He referred to the "Albanoi" as having taken part in a revolt against the Byzantine Empire in 1043, and to the "Arbanitai" as subjects of the Duke of Dyrrachium (modern Durrxc3xabs).The reference to "Arvanitai" from Attaliates regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078 is undisputed.The ethnonym Albanian has been hypothesized to be connected to and stem from the Albanoi,Little is known about the Albanian people prior to the 11th century, though a text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century in the Bulgarian language contains possibly a reference to the Albanian people.As he revolutionised the military and economic spheres of Egypt, his empire attracted Albanian people contributing to the emergence of the Albanian diaspora in Egypt initially formed by Albanian soldiers and mercenaries.Islam arrived in the lands of the Albanian people gradually and grew widespread between at least the 17th and 18th centuries.According to a 2008 report, there were approximately 1.300,000 people of Albanian descent living in Turkey.There are also other estimates that range from being 3 to 4 million people up to a total of 5& million in number, although most of these are Turkish citizens of either full or partial Albanian ancestry being no longer fluent in Albanian, comparable to the German Americans.In Egypt there are 18,000 Albanians, mostly Tosk speakers.The number could be higher counting the Arbxc3xabreshxc3xab people as well; they are often distinguishable from other Albanian Americans with regard to their Italianized names, nationality and a common religion.In Canada, there are more than approximately 39.000 Albanians in the country comprising 36,185 Albanians from Albania and 2,870 Albanians from Kosovo predominantly distributed in a multitude of provinces like Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. </my-abstract>

<headings> History , 
The ACM Portal is an online service of the ACM.
The ACM Digital Library is the full-text collection of all articles published by the ACM in its articles, magazines and conference proceedings. The Guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries.
The ACM Digital Library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organization's journals, magazines, newsletters and conference proceedings. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest. There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature. This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature.
ACM adopted a hybrid Open Access (OA) publishing model in 2013. Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement.
ACM was a "green" publisher before the term was invented. Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Library's permanently maintained Version of Record.
All metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world, including abstracts, linked references and citing works, citation and usage statistics, as well as all functionality and services. Other than the free articles, the full-texts are accessed by subscription.
There is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the open access movement. Some authors see a centralized peer&ndash;review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like arXiv. Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Journal of Machine Learning Research and the Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology.
 , 
In addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and "demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers".
The number of Fellows, Distinguished Members, and Senior Members cannot exceed 1%, 10%, and 25% of the total number of professional members, respectively.
 , 
The ACM Fellows Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 "to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM." There are 1163 Fellows  out of about 100,000 members.
 , 
In 2006, ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades, one which was called Distinguished Members. Distinguished Members (Distinguished Engineers, Distinguished Scientists, and Distinguished Educators) have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership and "have made a significant impact on the computing field". Note that in 2006 when the Distinguished Members first came out, one of the three levels was called "Distinguished Member" and was changed about two years later to "Distinguished Educator". Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles.
 , 
Also in 2006, ACM began recognizing Senior Members. According to the ACM, "The Senior Members Grade recognizes those ACM members with at least 10 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous Professional Membership who have demonstrated performance through technical leadership, and technical or professional contributions". Senior membership also requires 3 letters of reference
 , 
While not technically a membership grade, the ACM recognizes distinguished speakers on topics in computer science. A distinguished speaker is appointed for a three-year period. There are usually about 125 current distinguished speakers. The ACM website describes these people as 'Renowned International Thought Leaders'.
 , 
ACM has three kinds of chapters: Special Interest Groups,
, ACM has professional & SIG Chapters in 56 countries.
 , 
ACM and its Special Interest Groups (SIGs) sponsors numerous conferences with 170 hosted worldwide in 2017. [http://www.acm.org/conferences ACM Conferences page] has an up-to-date complete list while a partial list is shown below. Most of the SIGs also have an annual conference. ACM conferences are often very popular publishing venues and are therefore very competitive. For example, the 2007 SIGGRAPH conference attracted about 30000 visitors, and CIKM only accepted 15% of the long papers that were submitted in 2005.
The ACM is a co&ndash;presenter and founding partner of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) with the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology.
Some conferences are hosted by ACM student branches; this includes Reflections Projections, which is hosted by UIUC ACM.. In addition, ACM sponsors regional conferences. Regional conferences facilitate increased opportunities for collaboration between nearby institutions and they are well attended.
For additional non-ACM conferences, see this list of computer science conferences.
 , 
The ACM presents or co&ndash;presents a number of awards for outstanding technical and professional achievements and contributions in computer science and information technology.
Over 30 of ACM's Special Interest Groups also award individuals for their contributions with a few listed below.
 , 
The President of ACM for 2020–2022 is Gabriele Kotsis, Professor at the Johannes Kepler University Linz. She is successor of Cherri M. Pancake (2018–2020), Professor Emeritus at Oregon State University and Director of the Northwest Alliance for Computational Science and Engineering (NACSE); Vicki L. Hanson (2016–2018), Distinguished Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology and Visiting Professor at the University of Dundee; Alexander L. Wolf (2014–2016), Dean of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz; Vint Cerf (2012–2014), an American computer scientist who is recognized as one of "the fathers of the Internet"; Alain Chesnais (2010–2012), a French citizen living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he runs his company named Visual Transitions; and Dame Wendy Hall of the University of Southampton, UK (2008–2010).
ACM is led by a Council consisting of the President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Past President, SIG Governing Board Chair, Publications Board Chair, three representatives of the SIG Governing Board, and seven Members&ndash;At&ndash;Large. This institution is often referred to simply as "Council" in Communications of the ACM.
 , 
ACM has five "Boards" that make up various committees and subgroups, to help Headquarters staff maintain quality services and products. These boards are as follows:
# Publications Board
# SIG Governing Board
# Education Board
# Membership Services Board
# Practitioners Board
 , 
ACM-W, the ACM council on women in computing, supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in computing. ACM–W's main programs are regional celebrations of women in computing, ACM-W chapters, and scholarships for women CS students to attend research conferences. In India and Europe these activities are overseen by ACM-W India and ACM-W Europe respectively.  ACM-W collaborates with organizations such as the Anita Borg Institute, the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), and Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W).
 , 
The ACM-W gives an annual Athena Lecturer Award to honor outstanding women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science.
 , 
ACM's primary partner has been the IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS), which is the largest subgroup of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical computer science, but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda. They have many joint activities including conferences, publications and awards.
ACM has also jointly sponsored on events with other professional organizations like the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). because of problems when organizing conferences abroad.

<my-abstract> In 2015 there were some 300,000 Amish, more than 200,000 "Russian" Mennonites in Latin America, some 60,000 to 80,000 Old Order Mennonites and some 50,000 Hutterites, who have preserved their ethnicity, their German dialects (Pennsylvania German, Plautdietsch, Hutterisch), plain dress and other old traditions.The Bruderhof Communities were founded in Germany by Eberhard Arnold in 1920,Groups which are derived from the Schwarzenau Brethren, often called German Baptists, while not directly descended from the 16th-century Anabaptists, are usually considered Anabaptist because their doctrine and practice are almost identical to the doctrine and practice of Anabaptism.Some historical connections have been demonstrated for all of these spiritual descendants, though perhaps not as clearly as the noted institutionally lineal descendants.Although many see the more well-known Anabaptist groups (Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites) as ethnic groups, only the Amish and the Hutterites today are composed almost totally of descendants of the continental Anabaptists, while among the Mennonites there are Ethnic Mennonites and others who are not.In the 21st century, there are large cultural differences between assimilated Anabaptists, who do not differ much from evangelicals or mainline Protestants, and traditional groups like the Amish, the Old Colony Mennonites, the Old Order Mennonites, the Hutterites and the Old German Baptist Brethren.The early Anabaptists formulated their beliefs in the Schleitheim Confession, in 1527. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Thus the poem merely wonders if there had been a divine visit, when there was briefly heaven in England.The original text is found in the preface Blake wrote for inclusion with Milton, a Poem, following the lines beginning "The Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer & Ovid: of Plato & Cicero, which all Men ought to contemn: ..."Blake's poem mountains green:And was the holy Lamb of God,On Englands pleasant pastures seen!And did the Countenance Divine,Shine forth upon our clouded hills?And was Jerusalem builded here,Among these dark Satanic Mills?Bring me my Bow of burning gold:Bring me my Arrows of desire:Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold:Bring me my Chariot of fire!I will not cease from Mental Fight,Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand:Till we have built Jerusalem,In Englands green & pleasant Land.Beneath the poem Blake inscribed a quotation from the Bible:The phrase "dark Satanic Mills", which entered the English language from this poem, is often interpreted as referring to the early Industrial Revolution and its destruction of nature and human relationships.Elgar's orchestration has overshadowed Parry's own, primarily because it is the version usually used now for the Last Night of the Proms (though Sir Malcolm Sargent, who introduced it to that event in the 1950s, always used Parry's version).Although Parry composed the music as a unison song, many churches have adopted "Jerusalem" as a four-part hymn; a number of English entities, including the BBC, the Crown, cathedrals, churches, and chapels regularly use it as an office or recessional hymn on Saint George's Day.However, some clergy in the Church of England, according to the BBC TV programme Jerusalem: An Anthem for England, have said that the song is not technically a hymn as it is not a prayer to God (which they claim hymns always are, though many counter-examples appear in any hymnal).The film's working title was "Running" until Colin Welland saw a television programme, Songs of Praise, featuring the hymn and decided to change the title.The hymn has featured in many other films and television programmes including Four Weddings and a Funeral, How to Get Ahead in Advertising, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,  Saint Jack, Calendar Girls, Season 3: Episode 22 of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Goodnight Mr. Tom, Women in Love, The Man Who Fell to Earth, Shameless, Jackboots on Whitehall, Quatermass and the Pit, and Monty Python's Flying Circus . </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Bulletproof vests also began to be used, but since they were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected, they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.Access to famous persons also became more and more restricted; potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially with the common use of metal and bomb detectors.Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with US President John F. Kennedy and former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, or as part of a coup d'xc3xa9tat in which security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba.The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures.Failure to realize such divided loyalties allowed the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in 1984.The bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and it was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, which led assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as poison, whose risk was reduced by having another person taste the leader's food first.Another notable measure is the use of a body double, a person who looks like the leader and pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination via bombs or firearms became possible.Note that it is a different term and concept from that of "targeted violence", as used by specialists who study violence.On the other hand, Georgetown University Law Center Professor Gary D. Solis, in his 2010 book The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War, Abraham D. Sofaer, former federal judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, wrote on the subject:Author and former US Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan argued that "there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination."Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also stated in her article "By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'":Targeted killing has become a frequent tactic of the United States and Israel in their fight against terrorism.United Nations investigator Ben Emmerson said that US drone strikes may have violated international humanitarian law.One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins was employing bodyguards, who act as a shield for the potential target; keep a lookout for potential attackers, sometimes in advance, such as on a parade route; and putting themselves in harm's way, both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target, and by shielding the target if any attack occurs. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Pragmatics involves considerations that make reference to the user of the language; semantics considers expressions and what they denote (the designata) abstracted from the language user; and syntax considers only the expressions themselves, abstracted from the designata.Abstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept or object, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.The advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:The main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and might require a degree of mathematical maturity and experience before they can be assimilated.In music, the term abstraction can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of tonality.In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects, and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is itself an object).Chains of abstractions can  be construed, moving from neural impulses arising from sensory perception to basic abstractions such as color or shape, to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat, to semantic abstractions such as the "idea" of a CAT, to classes of objects such as "mammals" and even categories such as "object" as opposed to "action".Non-existent things in any particular place and time are often seen as abstract.b'      DESCRIPTION: Conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples.Abstract}}Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal ("real" or "concrete") signifiers, first principles, or other methods."An abstraction" is the outcome of this processxe2x80x94a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a group, field, or category.Conceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon,  selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjectively valued purpose. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Kingdom of Hungary and the First Austrian Republic were treated as its successors de jure, whereas the independence of the West Slavs and South Slavs of the Empire as the First Czechoslovak Republic, the Second Polish Republic and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, respectively, and most of the territorial demands of the Kingdom of Romania were also recognized by the victorious powers in 1920.The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (called the Ausgleich in German and the Kiegyezxc3xa9s in Hungarian), which inaugurated the empire's dual structure in place of the former Austrian Empire (1804xe2x80x931867), originated at a time when Austria had declined in strength and in powerxe2x80x94both in the Italian Peninsula (as a result of the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859) and among the states of the German Confederation (it had been surpassed by Prussia as the dominant German-speaking power following the Austro-Prussian War of 1866).The nationalist Hungarian parties xe2x80x93 which were supported by the overwhelming majority of ethnic Hungarian voters xe2x80x93 remained in the opposition, except from 1906xe2x80x931910 where the nationalist Hungarian parties were able to form government.In July 1849, the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament proclaimed and enacted ethnic and minority rights (the next such laws were in Switzerland), but these were overturned after the Russian and Austrian armies crushed the Hungarian Revolution.According to Misha Glenny in his book, The Balkans, 1804xe2x80x931999, the Austrians responded to Hungarian support of Czechs by supporting the Croatian national movement in Zagreb.In recognition that he reigned in a multi-ethnic country, Emperor Franz Joseph spoke (and used) German, Hungarian and Czech fluently, and Croatian, Serbian, Polish and Italian to some degree.Around 1900, Jews numbered about two million in the whole territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; They feared that such ethnic violence could ignite other ethnic minorities and escalate out of control.There were in addition a number of training institutes for teachers and a large number of schools of commerce, several art schools xe2x80x93 for design, painting, sculpture, music.The following present-day countries and parts of countries were within the boundaries of Austria-Hungary when the empire was dissolved:Empire of Austria (Cisleithania):Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania):Austro-Hungarian CondominiumPossessions of the Austro-Hungarian MonarchyOther parts of Europe had been part of the Habsburg monarchy once but had left it before its dissolution in 1918.]]Historical regions:Solely in the Empire of Austria:Solely in the Kingdom of Hungary:Data: census in 1910Primary and secondary schoolsThe organization of the Austrian elementary schools was based on the principle of compulsory school attendance, free education, and the imparting of public instruction in the child's own language.The old Charles University in Prague, hitherto dominated by German speakers, was divided into German and Czech-speaking faculties in 1882.At the same time, Hungarian dominance faced challenges from the local majorities of Romanians in Transylvania and in the eastern Banat, Slovaks in today's Slovakia, and Croats and Serbs in the crown lands of Croatia and of Dalmatia (today's Croatia), in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in the provinces known as the Vojvodina (today's northern Serbia).Each county had a municipal committee of 20 members, comprising 50% virilists (persons paying the highest direct taxes), and 50% elected persons fulfilling the prescribed census and ex officio members (deputy county head, main notary and others) The powers and responsibilities of the counties were constantly decreased and were transferred to regional agencies of the kingdom's ministries.Circuits (Kreise) of Bosnia and Herzegovina:Banja Luka, [[Bihaxc4x87, Mostar, Sarajevo, Travnik, Tuzla]]In 1878, Congress of Berlin placed the Bosnia Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire under Austro-Hungarian occupation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> the turning around and reattachment of the foot to allow the ankle joint to take over the function of the knee.Types of amputations include:; partial foot amputation: amputation of the lower limb distal to the ankle joint; ankle disarticulation: amputation of the lower limb at the ankle joint; trans-tibial amputation: amputation of the lower limb between the knee joint and the ankle joint, commonly referred to as a below-knee amputation; knee disarticulation: amputation of the lower limb at the knee joint; trans-femoral amputation: amputation of the lower limb between the hip joint and the knee joint, commonly referred to an above-knee amputation; hip disarticulation: amputation of the lower limb at the hip joint; trans-pelvic disarticulation: amputation of the whole lower limb together with all or part of the pelvis, also known as a hemipelvectomy or hindquarter amputationTypes of upper extremity amputations include:A variant of the trans-radial amputation is the Krukenberg procedure in which the radius and ulna are used to create a stump capable of a pincer action.Hemicorporectomy, or amputation at the waist, and decapitation, or amputation at the neck, are the most radical amputations.Genital modification and mutilation may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease.In some rare cases when a person has become trapped in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated his or her own limb.Muscles should be attached under similar tension to normal physiological conditions.An experimental technique known as the "Ewing amputation" aims to improve post-amputation proprioception.In 1920,&  Professor Janos Ertl, Sr., MD, of Hungary, developed the Ertl procedure in order to return a high number of amputees to the work force.A 2017 review found that the use of rigid removable dressings (RRD's) in trans-tibial amputations, rather than soft bandaging, improved healing time, reduced edema, prevented knee flexion contractures and reduced complications, including further amputation, from external trauma such as falls onto the stump.The development of the science of microsurgery over the last 40 years has provided several treatment options for a traumatic amputation, depending on the patient's specific trauma and clinical situation:Methods in preventing amputation, limb-sparing techniques, depend on the problems that might cause amputations to be necessary.The English word xe2x80x9cPoesxe2x80x9d was first applied to surgery in the 17th century, possibly first in Peter Lowe's A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie (published in either 1597 or 1612); his work was derived from 16th-century French texts and early English writers also used the words "extirpation" (16th-century French texts tended to use extirper), "disarticulation", and "dismemberment" (from the Old French desmembrer and a more common term before the 17th century for limb loss or removal), or simply "cutting", but by the end of the 17th century "amputation" had come to dominate as the accepted medical term.

<my-abstract> This study on Archaeopteryxs bone histology suggests that it was closest to true flying birds, and in particular to pheasants and other burst flyers.A histological study by Erickson, Norell, Zhongue, and others in 2009 estimated that Archaeopteryx grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, presumably because the outermost portions of Archaeopteryx bones appear poorly vascularized; One of the few modern birds that exhibit slow growth is the flightless kiwi, and the authors speculated that Archaeopteryx and the kiwi had similar basal metabolic rate.Comparisons between the scleral rings of Archaeopteryx and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been diurnal, similar to most modern birds.The islands that surrounded the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying, semi-arid, and sub-tropical with a long dry season and little rain.This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.               |2= }} }} }} }} }} }} }}It has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species, A. lithographica.In 2007, a review of all well-preserved specimens including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of Archaeopteryx could be supported: A. lithographica (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens), and A. siemensii (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.It can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a heat pump or air conditioning system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.Solar stills can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency multiple effect humidification designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).New technologies, like reverse osmosis can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air.Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.Rounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.An increasing number of commercial buildings use a combined cycle with cogeneration to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas reciprocating engine, gas turbine or stirling electric generator.Houses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a wood stove, or heat and power from diesel fuel or bottled gas, regardless of their other heating mechanisms.Electric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity.b'      DESCRIPTION: Building designed to be independent from public infrastructure.An autonomous building is a building designed to be operated independently from infrastructural support services such as the electric power grid, gas grid, municipal water systems, sewage treatment systems, storm drains, communication services, and in some cases, public roads.Advocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced environmental impacts, increased security, and lower costs of ownership.In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or stirling engines powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an absorptive chiller.A truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's diesel exhaust was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic ammonia gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler.The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.In annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It concluded, among other things, that Head Start programs designed to boost African-American IQ scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.The work became one of the most cited papers in the history of psychological testing and intelligence research, although a large number of citations consisted of rebuttals of Jensen's work, or references to it as an example of a controversial paper.Although a critic of Jensen's thesis, economist Thomas Sowell, criticizing the taboo against research on race and intelligence, wrote:However, Jensen's 1998 The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ.Reviewing this book, psychologist Kenneth Kaye endorsed Jensen's distinction between bias and discrimination, saying that he found many of Jensen's opponents to be more politically-biased than Jensen was.Melvin Konner of Emory University, wrote:Lisa Suzuki and Joshua Aronson of New York University wrote that Jensen had largely ignored evidence which failed to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent genetic racial differences.Paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould criticized Jensen's work in his 1981 book The Mismeasure of Man. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In liquid sulfur dioxide (), thionyl compounds (supplying ) behave as acids, and sulfites (supplying ) behave as bases.The non-aqueous acidxe2x80x93base reactions in liquid ammonia are similar to the reactions in water:Nitric acid can be a base in liquid sulfuric acid:The unique strength of this definition shows in describing the reactions in aprotic solvents; for example, in liquid :Because the solvent system definition depends on the solute as well as on the solvent itself, a particular solute can be either an acid or a base depending on the choice of the solvent:  is a strong acid in water, a weak acid in acetic acid, and a weak base in fluorosulfonic acid; this characteristic of the theory has been seen as both a strength and a weakness, because some substances (such as  and ) have been seen to be acidic or basic on their own right.The Brxc3xb8nsted-Lowry model explains this, showing the dissociation of water into low concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions:This equation is demonstrated in the image below:Here, one molecule of water acts as an acid, donating an H<sup>+</sup> and forming the conjugate base, OH<sup>xe2x88x92</sup>, and a second molecule of water acts as a base, accepting the H<sup>+</sup> ion and forming the conjugate acid, HO<sup>+</sup>.As an example of water acting as an acid, consider an aqueous solution of pyridine, CN.In this example, a water molecule is split into a hydrogen ion, which is donated to a pyridine molecule, and a hydroxide ion.In the Brxc3xb8nsted-Lowry model, the solvent does not necessarily have to be water that is required by the Arrhenius Acid-Base model.The Brxc3xb8nstedxe2x80x93Lowry model expanded what could be pH tested using insoluble and soluble solutions (gas, liquid, solid).The general formula for acidxe2x80x93base reactions according to the Brxc3xb8nstedxe2x80x93Lowry definition is:where HA represents the acid, B represents the base, BH<sup>+</sup> represents the conjugate acid of B, and A<sup>xe2x88x92</sup> represents the conjugate base of HA.For example, a Brxc3xb8nsted-Lowry model for the dissociation of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in aqueous solution would be the following:The removal of H<sup>+</sup> from the HCl produces the chloride ion, Cl<sup>xe2x88x92</sup>, the conjugate base of the acid.For example, the current Lewis model has the broadest definition of what an acid and base are, with the Brxc3xb8nsted-Lowry theory being a subset of what acids and bases are, and the Arrhenius theory being the most restrictive.The concept of an acid-base reaction was first proposed in 1754 by Guillaume-Franxc3xa7ois Rouelle, who introduced the word "base" into chemistry to mean a substance which reacts with an acid to give it solid form (as a salt).The first scientific concept of acids and bases was provided by Lavoisier in around 1776. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This campaign may be related to Gardizi's account of later expedition in 870 where he advanced as far as Bamiyan and Kabul.According to Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, Ghor which was ruled by Amir Suri in the 9th century entered into a war against him, but escaped conquest due to its difficult and mountainous terrain.After Ya'qub's death in 879, Al-Mu'tamid recognised his brother and successor 'Amr b. al-Layth (r. 879xe2x80x93902), as governor of Khorasan, Isfahan, Fars, Sistan and Sindh.Aufi states that Amr had sent Fardaghan as the prefect over Ghazna and he launched the raid on Sakawand, which was a part of the territory of Kabul Shahi and had a temple frequented by Hindus.The Saffarid governor 'Fard 'Ali was defeated and fled.The Samanids came to rule over areas including Khorasan, Sistan, Tokharistan and Kabulistan after Ismail (r. 892907) in 900 A.D. had defeated the Saffarids, who had taken over Zabulistan and the Kabul region.The Ghaznavids arose indirectly from the atmosphere of disintegration, palace revolutions and succession putschs of the Samanid Empire.Alp-Tegin proceeded with his small force of ghulams and ghazis (200 ghulams and 800 ghazis according to Siyasatnama, while Majma al-ansab of Muhammad b. Ali al-Shabankara'i (d. 1358) states 700 ghulams and 2,500 Tajiks).The inhabitants of various towns then concluded peace treaties with Fadl, one of which was identified by Josef Markwart as Kapisa.Al-Ma'mun (r. 813xe2x80x93833 A.D.) while visiting Khorasan, launched an attack on Kabul, whose ruler submitted to taxation.According to Baldhuri, when Qutayba ibn Muslim became the governor of Khorasan and Sistan, he appointed his brother 'Amr to Sistan.While Marw al-Rudh's garrison agreed to a peace term for the entire district under 300,000 dirhams, the town itself remained besieged.Al-Mada'ini specifically states that Ahnaf while leading the next expedition, didn't want to ask for assistance from the non-Muslims of Marw al-Rudh, probably as he didn't trust them.The permanent pacification of Khorasan was a protracted affair with the local potentates often rebelling and appealing to outside powers like the Hepthalites, Western Turks or Turgesh, Sogdians and the imperial Chinese who claimed a degree of suzerainty over Central Asia, for help.Peroz had settled among the Turks, took a local wife and had received troops from king of Tokharistan.The ruler (marzaban or azim) of the place agreed to a peace treaty for Herat, Badghis and Pushang for a tribute of 1 million dirhams.In 652, Ibn Amir sent al-Ahnaf to invade Tokharistan with 4,000 Arabs and 1,000 Iranian Muslims (evidently the Tamimis and asawira), probably because of assistance of its ruler to Yazdegerd's son Peroz.However, there is no evidence about the role of Buddhism during these periods or whether Buddhist monasteries remained the center of religious life and teaching.According to Ibn Khordadbeh, the Shah of Kabul had to send 2,000 Oghuz slaves worth 600,000 dirhams as annual tribute to the governor of Khorasan Abdallah ibn Tahir (828-845).The Tahirid rule was overthrown by Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar of Sistan, the first independent Iranian ruler in the post-Islamic era and fought the Abbasid Caliphate.Salih fled to ar-Rukhkhaj or Arachosia, where he received the help of the Zunbil.Sistan included a number of Afghan cities and regions including Ghazna, Zarang, Bost, Qandahar (also called al-Rukhkhaj or Zamindawar), Kabul, Kabulistan and Zabulistan.Before Muslim rule, the regions of Balkh (Bactria or Tokharistan), Herat and Sistan were under Sasanian rule. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A 2013 University of the Sunshine Coast study of the voting intentions of journalists found that 73.6 per cent of ABC journalists supported Labor or The Greens - with 41% supporting the Greens (whereas only around 10% of people in the general population voted Green).Conservative commentators such as Andrew Bolt, Tim Blair and Gerard Henderson accuse the ABC of a left-wing bias.Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke considered the ABC's coverage of the 1991 Gulf War to be biased.During the subsequent Howard Government years, ABC TV's masthead political programs were anchored by journalists with Labor affiliations: the 7.30 Report was hosted by former Whitlam staffer Kerry O'Brien; the Insiders program by former Hawke staffer Barrie Cassidy and the Lateline program by Maxine McKew who went on to defeat Liberal Prime Minister John Howard as the Labor candidate for the seat of Bennelong in 2007, at the same time as ABC Sydney News weatherman Mike Bailey ran for Labor against Liberal minister Joe Hockey.Chris Uhlmann, husband of Labor MP Gai Brodtmann, was appointed as co-host of the 7.30 current affairs program,Liberal Prime Minister Tony Abbott perceived the ABC to be left wing and hostile to his government, while his successor Malcolm Turnbull enjoyed better relations with the National Broadcaster.Many of these bulletins are heralded by the "Majestic Fanfare", written by British composer Charles Williams in 1935.In addition to these, there is also Radio Australia, the international radio station of the ABC.The ABC also operates several stations only available online and on digital platforms, as listed below.The ABC operates 5 national television channels.Although the ABC's headquarters in Sydney serve as a base for program distribution nationally, ABC Television network is composed of eight state- and territory-based stations, each based in their respective state capital and augmented by repeaters:The eight ABC stations carry opt outs for local programming.Nonetheless, many of the Cardinalxe2x80x99s most prominent supporters have regularly appeared on major ABC programs, and the ABCxe2x80x99s coverage has consistently included a wide diversity of voices, accurate news and authoritative analysis of the many complex legal issues raised by the case"In the aftermath of the unanimous acquittal of Cardinal George Pell by the High Court of Australia in 2020, Cardinal Pell and a variety of commentators accused the ABC of sustained bias against him and of "abuse of power".In response the ABC conducted an editorial and legal review of its coverage where it rejected the accusation of bias, and defended its reporting of Pell as having been "without fear or favour".Paul Kelly wrote: "The job of the ABC was to inform and educate on one of the most contentious trials in the past half-century.The first online election coverage was put together in 1996, and included news, electorate maps, candidate information and live results.By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24-hour-a-day operation, while regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters.International television service Australia Television International was established in 1993, while at the same time Radio Australia increased its international reach.Australia Television was sold to the Seven Network in 1998, however the service continued to show ABC news and current affairs programming up until its closure in 2001. and issuing his Whose ABC - 1983-2006.By mid-2006 the ABC had become an international leader in podcasting with over fifty podcast programmes delivering hundreds of thousands of downloads per week, including trial video podcasts of The Chaser's War on Everything and jtv.ABC Commercial is the division of the ABC responsible for pursuing new sources of revenue for the Corporation.Up until the installation of disc recording equipment in 1935, all content broadcast on the ABC was produced live, including music.There are currently six state symphony orchestras:The orchestras were corporatised in the 1990s, In the early years of television, the ABC had been using Lissajous curves as fillers between programmes.

<title>Asymptote</title>
<wiki-abstract> In analytic geometry, an asymptote () of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as one or both of the x or y coordinates tends to infinity. In projective geometry and related contexts, an asymptote of a curve is a line which is tangent to the curve at a point at infinity. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Oblique asymptotes are diagonal lines such that the difference between the curve and the line approaches 0 as x tends to +xe2x88x9e or &minus;xe2x88x9e.The line x = a is a vertical asymptote of the graph of the function  if at least one of the following statements is true:# <math>lim_{x to a^{-}} f(x)=pminfty,</math># <math>lim_{x to a^{+}} f(x)=pminfty,</math>where <math>lim_{xto a^-}</math> is the limit as x approaches the value a from the left (from lesser values), and <math>lim_{xto a^+}</math> is the limit as x approaches a from the right.For example, if xc6x92(x) = x/(xxe2x80x931), the numerator approaches 1 and the denominator approaches 0 as x approaches 1.A function f(x) is asymptotic to the straight line  (m& xe2x89xa0& 0) ifIn the first case the line  is an oblique asymptote of xc6x92(x) when x tends to +xe2x88x9e, and in the second case the line  is an oblique asymptote of xc6x92(x) when x tends to &minus;xe2x88x9e.An example is xc6x92(x)& =& x + 1/x, which has the oblique asymptote y& =& x (that is m& =& 1, n& =& 0) as seen in the limitsThe asymptotes of many elementary functions can be found without the explicit use of limits (although the derivations of such methods typically use limits).The oblique asymptote, for the function f(x), will be given by the equation y=mx+n.The horizontal line y& =& c is a horizontal asymptote of the function y& =& xc6x92(x) ifIn the first case, xc6x92(x) has y& =& c as asymptote when x tends to &minus;xe2x88x9e, and in the second xc6x92(x) has y& =& c as an asymptote as x tends to +xe2x88x9eFor example, the arctangent function satisfiesSo the line  is a horizontal asymptote for the arctangent when x tends to &minus;xe2x88x9e, and  is a horizontal asymptote for the arctangent when x tends to +xe2x88x9e.Functions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides, or may have one horizontal asymptote that is the same in both directions.This is because the other term,  1/(x+1), approaches 0.If the degree of the numerator is more than 1 larger than the degree of the denominator, and the denominator does not divide the numerator, there will be a nonzero remainder that goes to zero as x increases, but the quotient will not be linear, and the function does not have an oblique asymptote.If a known function has an asymptote (such as y=0 for f(x)=e<sup>x</sup>), then the translations of it also have an asymptote.If a known function has an asymptote, then the scaling of the function also have an asymptote.For example, f(x)=e<sup>x-1</sup>+2 has horizontal asymptote y=0+2=2, and no vertical or oblique asymptotes.Let  be a parametric plane curve, in coordinates A(t)& =& (x(t),y(t)). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Ariane 5 ES flew 8 times from 2008 to 2018 with no failures.Launch system status:  , the Ariane 5 commercial launch price for launching a "midsize satellite in the lower position" was approximately US$60 million,Total launch price of an Ariane 5 xe2x80x93 which can transport up to two satellites to space, one in the "upper" and one in the "lower" positions xe2x80x93 is around 150 million Euro as of January 2015.Originally known as the Ariane 5 ECB, Ariane 5 ME was to have its first flight in 2006.The launch had been originally scheduled for October 2004, but additional testing and the military requiring a launch at that time (of a Helios 2A observation satellite) delayed the attempt.On 11 August 2005, the first Ariane 5 GS (featuring the Ariane 5 ECA's improved solid motors) boosted Thaxc3xafcom-4/iPStar-1, the heaviest telecommunications satellite to date at 6505 kg, into orbit.On 16 November 2005, the third Ariane 5 ECA launch (the second successful ECA launch) took place. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b'      DESCRIPTION: European commercial space transportation company.{ }Arianespace SA is a multinational company founded in 1980 as the world's first commercial launch service provider.The formation of Arianespace SA is closely associated with the desire of several European nations to pursue joint collaboration in the field of space exploration and the formation of a pan-national organisation, the European Space Agency (ESA), to oversee such undertaking during 1973.France was the largest stakeholder in the Ariane development programme.Immediately following the successful first test launch of an Ariane 1 on 24 December 1979, the French space agency Centre national d'xc3xa9tudes spatiales (CNES) and the ESA created a new company, Arianespace, for the purpose of promoting, marketing, and managing Ariane operations.By early 1986, the Ariane 1, along with its Ariane 2 and Ariane 3 derivates, were the dominant launcher on the world market.On 15 June 1988, the first successful launch of the Ariane 4 was conducted.Even prior to the first flight of the Ariane 4 in 1988, development of a successor, designated as the Ariane 5, had already commenced.During the mid-1990s, French firms Axc3xa9rospatiale and SEP, along with Italian firm Bombrini-Parodi-Delfino (BPD), held discussions on the development of a proposed Ariane Complementary Launcher (ACL). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> For instance, the United States had prosecuted Japanese military officials after World War II and American soldiers after the Vietnam War for waterboarding.At a CIA black site in Thailand,Former CIA analyst and case officer John Kiriakou asserted that while Zubaydah was in CIA custody, a box of cockroaches were poured on him inside of a coffin he was confined to for two weeks, because of an irrational fear Zubaydah has of cockroaches.During Zubaydah's interrogation, President Bush learned he was on painkillers for his wounds and was proving resistant.Zubaydah was one of three or more high-value detainees to be waterboarded.Intelligence sources claimed as early as 2008 that Zubaydah had been waterboarded no less than ten times in the span of one week.The officials noted there was no independent verification of his claims.The U.S. government included statements made by Zubaydah in regards to al Qaeda's ability to obtain a dirty bomb to show a link between Iraq and al Qaeda.In the Senate Armed Services Committee 2008 report on the abuses of detainees, the Bush administration was described as having applied pressure to interrogators to find a link between Iraq and al Qaeda prior to the Iraq War.Colonel Lawrence B. Wilkerson, the former chief of staff for former Secretary of State Colin Powell said:So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee, even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney's office that their detainee "was compliant" (meaning the team recommended no more torture), the VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods.The General Counsel of the CIA asked for a legal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice about what was permissible during interrogation.In early July 2002, the Associate General Council CTC/Legal Group started drafting a memo to the Attorney General requesting the approval of "aggressive" interrogation methods, which otherwise would be prohibited under the provisions of Section 2340-2340B, Title 18, United States Code, on Abu Zubaydah.Journalists including Jane Mayer, Joby Warrick and Peter Finn, and Alex Koppelman have reported the CIA was already using these harsh tactics before the memo authorizing their use was written,The memo described ten techniques which the interrogators wanted to use: "(1) attention grasp, (2) walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard." </my-abstract>

<title>Arithmetic</title>
<wiki-abstract> Arithmetic (from the Greek [Greek|ἀριθμός] arithmos, 'number' and [Greek|τική] [Greek|[τέχνη]], tiké [téchne], 'art') is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations on them—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation and extraction of roots. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> For example, 507.36 denotes 5& hundreds (10<sup>2</sup>), plus 0& tens (10<sup>1</sup>), plus 7& units (10<sup>0</sup>), plus 3& tenths (10<sup>xe2x88x921</sup>) plus 6& hundredths (10<sup>xe2x88x922</sup>).The concept of 0 as a number comparable to the other basic digits is essential to this notation, as is the concept of& 0's use as a placeholder, and as is the definition of multiplication and addition with& 0.Before decimal-based systems of money and units of measure, compound unit arithmetic was widely used in commerce and industry.The techniques used in compound unit arithmetic were developed over many centuries and are well documented in many textbooks in many different languages.Knowledge of the relationship between the various units of measure, their multiples and their submultiples forms an essential part of compound unit arithmetic.There are two basic approaches to compound unit arithmetic:The addition operation is carried out from right to left; in this case, pence are processed first, then shillings followed by pounds.).Decimal representation refers exclusively, in common use, to the written numeral system employing arabic numerals as the digits for a radix 10& ("decimal") positional notation; however, any numeral system based on powers of& 10, e.g., Greek, Cyrillic, Roman, or Chinese numerals may conceptually be described as "decimal notation" or "decimal representation".Modern methods for four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) were first devised by Brahmagupta of India. </my-abstract>

<title>Aspirated consonant</title>
<wiki-abstract> In phonetics, aspiration is the strong burst of breath that accompanies either the release or, in the case of preaspiration, the closure of some obstruents. In English, aspirated consonants are allophones in complementary distribution with their unaspirated counterparts, but in some other languages, notably most Indian and East Asian languages, the difference is contrastive. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Stops are distinguished primarily by voicing, and voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated, while voiced stops are usually unaspirated.English voiceless stops are aspirated for most native speakers when they are word-initial or begin a stressed syllable.For instance, distend has unaspirated  since it is not analyzed as two morphemes, but distaste has an aspirated middle  because it is analyzed as dis- + taste and the word taste has an aspirated initial t.Word-final voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated.Voiceless stops in Pashto are slightly aspirated prevocalically in a stressed syllable.In many languages, such as Armenian, Korean, Lakota, Thai, Indo-Aryan languages, Dravidian languages, Icelandic, Faroese, Ancient Greek, and the varieties of Chinese, tenuis and aspirated consonants are phonemic.Earlier Greek, represented by Mycenaean Greek, likely had a labialized velar aspirated stop , which later became labial, coronal, or velar depending on dialect and phonetic environment.The other Ancient Greek dialects, Ionic, Doric, Aeolic, and Arcadocypriot, likely had the same three-way distinction at one point, but Doric seems to have had a fricative in place of  in the Classical period, and the Ionic and Aeolic dialects sometimes lost aspiration (psilosis).Later, during the Koine Greek period, the aspirated and voiced stops  of Attic Greek lenited to voiceless and voiced fricatives, yielding  in Medieval and Modern Greek.In native Dravidian words, there is no distinction between these categories and stops are underspecified for voicing and aspiration., , <br>"chisel, give!, sword"<br><br>}}Most dialects of Armenian have aspirated stops, and some have breathy-voiced stops.Classical and Eastern Armenian have a three-way distinction between voiceless, aspirated, and voiced, such as .Western Armenian has a two-way distinction between aspirated and voiced: . </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This version was also played in Hamburg, Dresden, Hanover, and Berlin, although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, Niemann-Raabe eventually restored the original ending.In Great Britain, the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given in London was in an adaptation by Henry Arthur Jones and Henry Herman called Breaking a Butterfly.Before 1899 there were two private productions of the play in London (in its original form as Ibsen wrote it)  xe2x80x94 one featured George Bernard Shaw in the role of Krogstad.The play was first seen in America in 1883 in Louisville, Kentucky; Helena Modjeska acted Nora.The play was performed by 24/6: A Jewish Theater Company in March 2011, one of their early performances following their December 2010 lower Manhattan launch.In August 2013, Young Vic, based on the English language version by Simon Stephens.In September 2014, in partnership with Brisbane Festival, La Boite located in Brisbane, Australia, hosted an adaptation of A Doll's House written by Lally Katz and directed by Stephen Mitchell Wright.A Doll's House questions the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-century marriage.The Swedish playwright August Strindberg criticised the play in his volume of essays and short stories Getting Married (1884).The reasons Nora leaves her husband are complex, and various details are hinted at throughout the play.In the play, Nora leaves Torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time.Kieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as "Ibsen's Nora" years afterwards.Ibsen started thinking about the play around May 1878, although he did not begin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period (he visualised its protagonist, Nora, for instance, as having approached him one day wearing "a blue woolen dress"). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Six Serbian MiG-29 were shot down by NATO (four USAF F-15Cs, one USAF F-16C, and one Dutch F-16A MLU), all of them using AIM-120 missiles (the supposed kill by the F-16C may have actually been friendly fire, an SA-7 MANPADS fired by Serbian infantry).As of 2017, the AIM-120 AMRAAM has shot down eleven aircraft (six MiG-29s, one MiG-25, one MiG-23, one Su-22, one Soko J-21 Jastreb, and one UH-60 Black Hawk).On 7 August 2018, a Spanish Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon accidentally launched a missile in Estonia.On 27 February 2019, Pakistan Air Force claimed two kills (including one confirmed kill of Indian Air Force MiG-21 Bison flown by Wg Cdr Abhinandan Varthaman) during Operation Swift Retort.When an AMRAAM missile is launched, NATO pilots use the brevity code Fox Three.The AMRAAM is the world's most popular beyond-visual-range missile; more than 14,000 have been produced for the United States Air Force, the United States Navy, and 33 international customers.The AIM-7 Sparrow medium range missile (MRM) was purchased by the US Navy from original developer Hughes Aircraft in the 1950s as its first operational air-to-air missile with "beyond visual range" (BVR) capability.The US Navy needed AMRAAM to be carried on the F/A-18 Hornet and wanted capability for two to be carried on a launcher that normally carried one Sparrow to allow for more air-to-ground weapons.The AMRAAM became one of the primary air-to-air weapons of the new F-22 Raptor fighter, which needed to place all of its weapons into internal weapons bays in order to help achieve an extremely low radar cross-section.AMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement (the Family of Weapons MOA, no longer in effect by 1990), among the United States and several other NATO nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology.A more recent version of the program is the High Mobility Launcher, made in cooperation with Raytheon (Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace was already a subcontractor on the SLAMRAAM system), where the launch-vehicle is a Humvee (M1152A1 HMMWV), containing four AMRAAMs each.The US Army has test fired the SL-AMRAAM from a HIMARS artillery rocket launcher as a common launcher, as part of a move to switch to a larger and more survivable launch platform.On January 6, 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that the U.S. Army has decided to terminate acquisition of the SLAMRAAM as part of a budget-cutting effort.The National Guard Association of the United States has sent a letter asking for the U.S. Senate to stop the Army's plan to drop the SLAMRAAM program because without it there would be no path to modernize the Guard's AN/TWQ-1 Avenger Battalions.The AMRAAM was used for the first time on December 27, 1992, when a USAF F-16D shot down an Iraqi MiG-25 that violated the southern no-fly-zone. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The test program planned for the 25& mm GAU-12/U and 40& mm Bofors cannon on the AC-130U gunships to be replaced with two 30& mm Mk 44 Bushmaster II cannons.Plans were made to possibly replace the 105& mm cannon with a breech-loading 120& mm M120 mortar, and to give the AC-130 a standoff capability using either the AGM-114 Hellfire missile, the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (based on the Hydra 70 rocket), or the Viper Strike glide bomb.In 2010, the Air Force awarded L-3 Communications a $61& million contract to add precision strike packages to eight MC-130W Combat Spear special-mission aircraftThe Air Force launched an initiative in 2011 to acquire 16 new gunships based on newly built MC-130J Combat Shadow II special-operations tankers outfitted with a "precision strike package" to give them an attack capability, requesting $1.6& billion from fiscal years 2011 through 2015."Ultimate End" was reassigned to the Air Force Reserve's 919th Special Operations Wing at Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field No.3 / Duke Field on 17 June 1975, where it continued in service until retired in the fall 1994 and transferred to Air Force Special Operations Command's Heritage Air Park at Hurlburt Field, Florida.AC-130s destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and participated in many crucial close-air-support missions in Vietnam.With the conclusion of hostilities in Southeast Asia in the mid-1970s, the AC-130H became the sole gunship in the regular Air Force, home based at Hurlburt Field, Florida, while the AC-130A fleet was transferred to the Air Force Reserve's 919th Tactical Airlift Group (919 TAG) at Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #3/Duke Field, Florida.AC-130s took part in Operation Assured Response in Liberia in 1996 and in Operation Silver Wake in 1997, the evacuation of American non-combatants from Albania.AC-130s took part in the NATO missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo during the 1990s.The AC-130U gunship set a new record for the longest sustained flight by any C-130 on 22 and 23 October 1997, when two AC-130U gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from Hurlburt Field to Taegu Air Base (Daegu), South Korea, being refueled seven times in the air by KC-135 tankers. </my-abstract>

<title>Arbitrage</title>
<wiki-abstract> In economics and finance, arbitrage (,  ) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices at which the unit is traded. When used by academics, an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Since the inefficiency is related to government tax policy, and hence is structural in nature, it has not been arbitraged away.However, many municipal bonds are callable, and this adds substantial risks to the strategy.A convertible bond is a bond that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company.A convertible bond can be thought of as a corporate bond with a stock call option attached to it.The price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors:Given the complexity of the calculations involved and the convoluted structure that a convertible bond can have, an arbitrageur often relies on sophisticated quantitative models in order to identify bonds that are trading cheap versus their theoretical value.Convertible arbitrage consists of buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors in order to gain exposure to the third factor at a very attractive price.For instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond, then sell fixed income securities or interest rate futures (to hedge the interest rate exposure) and buy some credit protection (to hedge the risk of credit deterioration).Eventually what he'd be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock, acquired at a very low price.He could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or delta hedging his exposure to the underlying shares.A depositary receipt is a security that is offered as a "tracking stock" on another foreign market.The prices of the bonds in t.Arbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met:#The same asset does not trade at the same price on all markets ("the law of one price").#Two assets with identical cash flows do not trade at the same price.#An asset with a known price in the future does not today trade at its future price discounted at the risk-free interest rate (or the asset has significant costs of storage; so this condition holds true for something like grain but not for securities).Arbitrage is not simply the act of buying a product in one market and selling it in another for a higher price at some later time.The arbitrageur immediately buys the bond from the Virginia dealer and sells it to the Washington dealer.Also called risk arbitrage, merger arbitrage generally consists of buying/holding the stock of a company that is the target of a takeover while shorting the stock of the acquiring company.Usually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company.The spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed as well as the prevailing level of interest rates.The bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero, if and when the takeover is completed.The main, rare risks are counterparty risk, and liquidity risk: that a counterparty to a large transaction or many transactions fails to pay, or that one is required to post margin and does not have the money to do so.In the academic literature, the idea that seemingly very low risk arbitrage trades might not be fully exploited because of these risk factors and other considerations is often referred to as limits to arbitrage.Generally it is impossible to close two or three transactions at the same instant; therefore, there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed, a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price.For example, an arbitrage opportunity is present when there is the possibility to instantaneously buy something for a low price and sell it for a higher price.In principle and in academic use, an arbitrage is risk-free; in common use, as in statistical arbitrage, it may refer to expected profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always risks in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative). </my-abstract>

Equivalently, it is the least common multiple of the orders of the elements of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n.For powers of odd primes and for 2 and 4, xcexbb(n) is equal to the Euler totient function of n; for powers of 2 greater than 4 it is equal to one half of the Euler totient function of n:begin{cases};;phi(n) &text{if }n = 2,3,4,5,7,9,11,13,17,19,23,25,27,dotstfrac12phi(n)&text{if }n=8,16,32,64,dotsend{cases}and for general n it is the least common multiple of xcexbb of each of the prime power factors of n:h(n), the class number function, is the order of the ideal class group of an algebraic extension of the rationals with discriminant n. The notation is ambiguous, as there are in general many extensions with the same discriminant.The simplest such series, corresponding to the constant function a(n) = 1 for all n, is xcfx82(s) the Riemann zeta function.The generating function of the Mxc3xb6bius function is the inverse of the zeta function:zeta(s),sum_{n=1}^inftyfrac{mu(n)}{n^s}=1, ;;mathfrak{R} ,s >0.Consider two arithmetic functions a and b and their respective generating functions F(s) can be computed as follows:It is a straightforward exercise to show that if c(n) is defined bythenThis function c is called the Dirichlet convolution of a and b, and is denoted by <math>a*b</math>.A particularly important case is convolution with the constant function a(n) = 1 for all n, corresponding to multiplying the generating function by the zeta function:g(n) = sum_{dmid n}f(d).Multiplying by the inverse of the zeta function gives the Mxc3xb6bius inversion formula:f(n) = sum_{dmid n}muleft(frac{n}{d}right)g(d).If f is multiplicative, then so is g. If f is completely multiplicative, then g is multiplicative, but may or may not be completely multiplicative.There are a great many formulas connecting arithmetical functions with each other and with the functions of analysis, especially powers, roots, and the exponential and log functions.This article provides links to functions of both classes.Many of the functions mentioned in this article have expansions as series involving these sums; see the article Ramanujan's sum for examples.An arithmetic function a isTwo whole numbers m and n are called coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1, that is, if there is no prime number that divides both of them.Then an arithmetic function a isSimilarly, &  <math>sum_{p^k} f(p^k)</math> &  and &  <math>prod_{p^k} f(p^k)</math> &  mean that the sum or product is over all prime powers with strictly positive exponent (so k = 0 is not included):The notations can be combined: &  <math>sum_{pmid n} f(p)</math> &  and &  <math>prod_{pmid n} f(p)</math> &  mean that the sum or product is over all prime divisors of n.

<my-abstract> , Section: [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf Summary for Policymakers (finalized version)], page 4, footnote 2.Some of the main human activities that contribute to global warming are:In addition to human activities, some natural mechanisms can also cause climate change, including for example, climate oscillations, changes in solar activity, and volcanic activity.Multiple lines of evidence support attribution of recent climate change to human activities:Factors affecting Earth's climate can be broken down into feedbacks and forcings.(2007) allowed for the possibility that climate models had been underestimated the effect of solar forcing.Hegerl, et al., [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9.html Chapter 9: Understanding and Attributing Climate Change], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-es.html Executive Summary], in.</ref>The role of solar activity in climate change has also been calculated over longer time periods using "proxy" datasets, such as tree rings.Another line of evidence against the sun having caused recent climate change comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere have changed.Models and observations (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming of the lower atmosphere at the surface (called the troposphere) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the stratosphere).Scientists then applied fingerprint methods to a whole range of climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the tropopause (the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, drought, surface pressure, and the runoff from major river basins.Studies published after the appearance of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 have also found human fingerprints in the increased levels of atmospheric moisture (both close to the surface and over the full extent of the atmosphere), in the decline of Arctic sea ice extent, and in the patterns of changes in Arctic and Antarctic surface temperatures.The message from this entire body of work is that the climate system is telling a consistent story of increasingly dominant human influence xe2x80x93 the changes in temperature, ice extent, moisture, and circulation patterns fit together in a physically consistent way, like pieces in a complex puzzle.Increasingly, this type of fingerprint work is shifting its emphasis.Human activities can also impose forcings, for example, through changing the composition of the atmosphere.Radiative forcing is a measure of how various factors alter the energy balance of the Earth's atmosphere.Climate feedbacks can either amplify or dampen the response of the climate to a given forcing.There are many feedback mechanisms in the climate system that can either amplify (a positive feedback) or diminish (a negative feedback) the effects of a change in climate forcing.The climate system will vary in response to changes in forcings.The climate system will show internal variability both in the presence and absence of forcings imposed on it, (see images opposite). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Once this condition is met, it is sufficient that local bonding at the specimen surface is capable of being overcome by the field, allowing for evaporation of an atom from the surface to which it is otherwise bonded.Whether evaporated from the material itself, or ionised from the gas, the ions that are evaporated are accelerated by electrostatic force, acquiring most of their energy within a few tip-radii of the sample.Subsequently, the accelerative force on any given ion is controlled by the electrostatic equation, where n is the ionisation state of the ion, and e is the fundamental electric charge.This can be equated with the mass of the ion, m, via Newton's law (F=ma):Relativistic effects in the ion flight are usually ignored, as realisable ion speeds are only a very small fraction of the speed of light.Assuming that the ion is accelerated during a very short interval, the ion can be assumed to be travelling at constant velocity.Practical tip to screen distances may range from several centimeters to several meters, with increased detector area required at larger to subtend the same field of view.Practically speaking, the usable magnification will be limited by several effects, such as lateral vibration of the atoms prior to evaporation.Whilst the magnification of both the field ion and atom probe microscopes is extremely high, the exact magnification is dependent upon conditions specific to the examined specimen, so unlike for conventional electron microscopes, there is often little direct control on magnification, and furthermore, obtained images may have strongly variable magnifications due to fluctuations in the shape of the electric field at the surface.The computational conversion of the ion sequence data, as obtained from a position sensitive detector, to a three-dimensional visualisation of atomic types, is termed "reconstruction".It combined a field ion microscope with a mass spectrometer having a single particle detection capability and, for the first time, an instrument could xe2x80x9c... determine the nature of one single atom seen on a metal surface and selected from neighboring atoms at the discretion of the observerxe2x80x9d.Atom probes are unlike conventional optical or electron microscopes, in that the magnification effect comes from the magnification provided by a highly curved electric field, rather than by the manipulation of radiation paths. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> On January 25, 1947, he died of cardiac arrest after suffering a stroke.Capone was born in Brooklyn, New York on January 17, 1899.Gabriele and Teresa had eight other children: Vincenzo Capone, who later changed his name to Richard Hart and became a Prohibition agent in Homer, Nebraska; Raffaele James Capone, also known as Ralph "Bottles" Capone, who took charge of his brother's beverage industry; Salvatore "Frank" Capone, Ermina Capone, who died at the age of one, Ermino "John" Capone, Albert Capone, Matthew Capone, and Mafalda Capone.Capone's underboss, Frank Nitti took over as boss of the Outfit after he was released from prison in March 1932, having also been convicted of tax evasion charges.Due to his failing health, Capone was released from prison on November 16, 1939, Though it was too late for him to reverse the damage in his brain, it did slow down the progression of the disease.In 1946, his physician and a Baltimore psychiatrist examined him and concluded that Capone had the mentality of a 12-year-old child.According to an article from February 9, 1936 by Guy Murchie Jr. from the Chicago Daily Tribune, 33 people died as a consequence of Al Capone's actions.Some historians have speculated that Capone ordered the murder of Edward J. O'Hare in 1939 for helping federal prosecutors convict Capone of tax evasion, though there are other theories for O'Hare's death. </my-abstract>

<title>Amplifier figures of merit</title>
<wiki-abstract> In electronics, the figures of merit of an amplifier are numerical measures that characterize its properties and performance. Figures of merit can be given as a list of specifications that include properties such as gain, bandwidth, noise and linearity, among others listed in this article. </wiki-abstract>

<headings>  Gain  , 
An ideal amplifier would be a totally linear device, but real amplifiers are only linear within limits.
When the signal drive to the amplifier is increased, the output also increases until a point is reached where some part of the amplifier becomes saturated and cannot produce any more output; this is called clipping, and results in distortion.
In most amplifiers a reduction in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; the result is a compression effect, which (if the amplifier is an audio amplifier) sounds much less unpleasant to the ear. For these amplifiers, the 1& dB compression point is defined as the input power (or output power) where the gain is 1& dB less than the small signal gain. Sometimes this non linearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.
Ill effects of non-linearity can be reduced with negative feedback.
Linearization is an emergent field, and there are many techniques, such as feed forward, predistortion, postdistortion, in order to avoid the undesired effects of the non-linearities.
 , 
This is a measure of how much noise is introduced in the amplification process. Noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, much noise results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. The metric for noise performance of a circuit is noise figure or noise factor. Noise figure is a comparison between the output signal to noise ratio and the thermal noise of the input signal.

<lines> 25 </lines>
<my-abstract> Many amplifiers are ultimately slew rate limited (typically by the impedance of a drive current having to overcome capacitive effects at some point in the circuit), which sometimes limits the full power bandwidth to frequencies well below the amplifier's small-signal frequency response.The rise time, t, of an amplifier is the time taken for the output to change from 10% to 90% of its final level when driven by a step input.For a Gaussian response system (or a simple RC roll off), the rise time is approximated by:t is rise time in seconds and BW is bandwidth in Hz.The time taken for the output to settle to within a certain percentage of the final value (for instance 0.1%) is called the settling time, and is usually specified for oscilloscope vertical amplifiers and high-accuracy measurement systems. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b'      Patriarch Athanasius of Alexandria|and|Pope Athanasius (disambiguation)Pope Athanasius}}DESCRIPTION: Patriarch of Alexandria.{ }{ }Athanasius of Alexandria; , ; ;}} (c. 296xe2x80x93298 xe2x80x93 2 May 373), also called Athanasius the Great, Athanasius the Confessor or, primarily in the Coptic Orthodox Church, Athanasius the Apostolic, was the 20th bishop of Alexandria (as Athanasius I).Because Athanasius' Canon is the closest canon of any of the Church Fathers to the one used by Protestant churches today, many Protestants point to Athanasius as the Father of the Canon.In the light of Francis A. M. Forbes' research and reference to Pope Gregory I's writings, it would appear that Athanasius was constrained to be Bishop: She writes that when the Patriarch Alexander was on his death-bed he called Athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made Bishop.Constantius' persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop George of Laodicea, prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional History of the Arians, in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the Antichrist.Constantius ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him three days to comply.On 2 May 373, having consecrated Peter II, one of his presbyters as his successor, Athanasius died peacefully in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful supporters.In Coptic literature, Athanasius is the first patriarch of Alexandria to use Coptic as well as Greek in his writings., that the Son of God, the eternal Word (Logos) through whom God created the world, entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away.His other important works include his Letters to Serapion, which defends the divinity of the Holy Spirit.The formulary of faith drawn up by Hosius is known as the Nicene Creed.While still a deacon under Alexander's care (or early in his patriarchate as discussed below) Athanasius may have also become acquainted with some of the solitaries of the Egyptian desert, and in particular Anthony the Great, whose life he is said to have written.In about 319, when Athanasius was a deacon, a presbyter named Arius came into a direct conflict with Alexander of Alexandria. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The islands of the Azores emerged from what is called the Azores Plateau, a 5.8& million km<sup>2</sup> region that is morphologically accented by a depth of .From a geostructural perspective the Azores is located above an active triple junction between three of the world's large tectonic plates (the North American Plate, the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate), The westernmost islands of the archipelago (Corvo and Flores) are located in the North American Plate, while the remaining islands are located within the boundary that divides the Eurasian and African Plates.The principal tectonic structures that exist in the region of the Azores are the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Terceira Rift, the Azores Fracture Zone and the Glxc3xb3ria Fault.They range in surface area from the largest, Sxc3xa3o Miguel, at  to the smallest, Corvo, at approximately .Each of the islands has its own distinct geomorphological characteristics that make them unique: Corvo (the smallest island) is a crater of a major Plinian eruption; Flores (its neighbor on the North American Plate) is a rugged island carved by many valleys and escarpments; Faial characterized for its shield volcano and caldera (Cabexc3xa7o Gordo); Pico, is the highest point, at , in the Azores and continental Portugal; Graciosa is known for its active Furnas do Enxofre and mixture of volcanic cones and plains; Sxc3xa3o Jorge is a long slender island, formed from fissural eruptions over thousands of years; Terceira, almost circular, is the location of one of the largest craters in the region; Sxc3xa3o Miguel is the largest island, and is pitted with many large craters and fields of spatter cones; and Santa Maria, the oldest island, is heavily eroded, being one of the few places to encounter brown sandy beaches in the archipelago.The Azorean Liberation Front attempted to take advantage of this instability immediately after the revolution, hoping to establish an independent Azores, until operations ceased in 1975.In 1976, the Azores became the Autonomous Region of the Azores (), one of the autonomous regions of Portugal, and the subdistricts of the Azores were eliminated.In 2003, the Azores saw international attention when United States president George W. Bush, British prime minister Tony Blair and Spanish prime minister Josxc3xa9 Marxc3xada Aznar and Portuguese prime minister Josxc3xa9 Manuel Durxc3xa3o Barroso held a summit there days before the commencement of the Iraq War.The archipelago of the Azores is located in the middle of the northern hemisphere of the Atlantic Ocean and extends along a west-northwest to east-southeast orientation (between 36.5xc2xb0xe2x80x9340xc2xb0 North latitudes and 24.5xc2xb0xe2x80x9331.5xc2xb0 West longitudes) in an area approximately  wide.The Glxc3xb3ria Fault, for its part, extends  along a linear line from the Azores to the Azoresxe2x80x93Gibraltar Transform Fault.The island's volcanism is associated with the rifting along the Azores Triple Junction; the spread of the crust along the existing faults and fractures has produced many of the active volcanic and seismic events, The islands have many examples of volcano-built geomorphology including caves and lava tubes (such as the Gruta das Torres, Algar do Carvxc3xa3o, Gruta do Natal, Gruta das Cinco Ribeiras), the coastal lava fields (like the coast of Feteiras, Faial, the Mistxc3xa9rio of Prainha or Sxc3xa3o Joxc3xa3o on Pico Island) in addition to the inactive cones in central Sxc3xa3o Miguel Island, the aforementioned Capelinhos on Faial, the volcanic complexes of Terceira or Plinian caldeira of Corvo Island.The islands of the archipelago were formed through volcanic and seismic activity during the Neogene Period; the first embryonic surfaces started to appear in the waters of Santa Maria during the Miocene epoch (from circa 8& million years ago). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Outback is more remote than the bush, which includes any location outside the main urban areas.While often envisaged as being arid, the Outback regions extend from the northern to southern Australian coastlines and encompass a number of climatic zones, including tropical and monsoonal climates in northern areas, arid areas in the "red centre" and semi-arid and temperate climates in southerly regions.Geographically, the Outback is unified by a combination of factors, most notably a low human population density, a largely intact natural environment and, in many places, low-intensity land uses, such as pastoralism (livestock grazing) in which production is reliant on the natural environment.The Outback is deeply ingrained in Australian heritage, history and folklore.In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Queensland Outback was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a "natural attraction".Indigenous Australians have lived in the Outback for approximately 50,000 yearsOver the period 1858 to 1861, John McDouall Stuart led six expeditions north from Adelaide, South Australia into the outback, culminating in successfully reaching the north coast of Australia and returning without the loss of any of the party's members' lives. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The most central one being Forum Aveiro with clothes stores, restaurant zone, a book shop and a cinema.The town's unemployment rate in 2015 was 12.5%; the university is a major employer.Tourism is also important for the economy.Important tourist attractions are the Arte Nova (Art Nouveau) architectural designs and tiles of some buildings that were created in the early 20th century,The local economy is fed by a series of transport networks that cross the municipal boundaries.Regional gateways include air service through the Aerxc3xb3dromo de Aveiro/Sxc3xa3o Jacinto (LPAV) and the Porto de Aveiro (xc3x8dlhavo/Aveiro).Rail service includes service by Alfa Pendular (between Lisbon and Braga; Lisbon and Oporto; Faro and Oporto) and Intercity (between Lisbon and Oporto as well as Lisbon and Guimarxc3xa3es) trains; suburban links through the Urbanos do Porto and, also, the Linha do Vouga, a narrow gauge railway to xc3x81gueda and Sernada do Vouga.The primary expressways and inter-regional thoroughfares include: A1 (between Porto and Lisbon); and the A25 (which links Viseu, Guarda and Vilar Formoso).Intercity buses connect Aveiro with Porto and Lisbon several times a day.In 2011, the population was 78,450,).The presence of human settlement in the territory of Aveiro extends to the period associated with the great dolmens of pre-history, which exist in most of the region.For a long period Aveiro was an important economic link in the production of salt and commercial shipping.From 11th century onwards, Aveiro became popular with Portuguese royalty.Later, King Joxc3xa3o I, on the advice of his son Pedro, who was the donatary of Aveiro, requested the construction of fortification walls.King D. Duarte conceded in 1435 the privilege of providing an annual duty-free fair, later referred to as the Feira de Marxc3xa7o (March Fair), today still an annual tradition.The Princess St. Joana, daughter of Afonso V lived in Aveiro, entering the convent of Jesus, and lived there until her death on 12 May 1490.In the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, but was transformed into the Museu de Santa Joana, or simply, the Museum of Aveiro, housing many of these handicrafts.The abundance of 19th-20th century architectural buildings reflects the effects of the boom during that period, including many of the Art Novo and Art Deco buildings, inspired by modernist trends and Nationalist tendencies of the Estado Novo regime.There are several attractions in the city of Aveiro, including cathedrals, canals and the beaches, including the xc3x8dlhavo ceramica de Vista Alegre and the beaches of Barra, Costa Nova do Prado, and Gafanha da Nazarxc3xa9.Aveiro is known in Portugal for its traditional sweets, Ovos Moles de Aveiro (PGI), trouxas de ovos, both made from eggs. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of dissociative disorders (cross-cultural variant).In 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.An example would be during the Battle of Bukit Chandu in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by Adnan Saidi, charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.The earliest known mention of the expression "Apostles' Creed" occurs in a letter of AD& 390 from a synod in Milan and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the Twelve Apostles contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.The title Symbolum Apostolicum (Symbol or Creed of the Apostles) appears for the first time in a letter, probably written by Ambrose, from a Council in Milan to Pope Siricius in about AD& 390 "Let them give credit to the Creed of the Apostles, which the Roman Church has always kept and preserved undefiled".The account of the origin of this creed, the forerunner and principal source of the Apostles' Creed, as having been jointly created by the Apostles under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, with each of the twelve contributing one of the articles, was already current at that time.The earlier text evolved from simpler texts based on ,While the individual statements of belief that are included in the Apostles' Creed xe2x80x93 even those not found in the Old Roman Symbol xe2x80x93 are found in various writings by Irenaeus, Tertullian, Novatian, Marcellus, Rufinus, Ambrose, Augustine, Nicetas, and Eusebius Gallus,As can be seen from various creeds all quoted in full below, although the original Greek and Latin creeds both specifically refer to xe2x80x9cthe resurrection of the fleshxe2x80x9d (xcfx83xcexb1xcfx81xcexbaxe1xbdxb8xcfx82 xe1xbcx80xcexbdxcexacxcfx83xcfx84xcexb1xcfx83xcexb9xcexbd and carnis resurrectionem), the versions used by several churches, like the Catholic Church, the Church of England, Lutheran churches and Methodist churches, talk more generally of xe2x80x9cthe resurrection of the bodyxe2x80x9d.Some have suggested that the Apostles' Creed was spliced together with phrases from the New Testament.This phrase and that on the communion of saints are articles found in the Apostles' Creed, but not in the Old Roman Symbol nor in the Nicene Creed.}}.</ref>The International Consultation on English Texts (ICET), a first inter-church ecumenical group that undertook the writing of texts for use by English-speaking Christians in common, published Prayers We Have in Common (Fortress Press, 1970,1971,1975).It included the following translation of the Apostles' Creed:.In its discussion of the contents of the Creed, the Catechism of the Catholic Church presents it in the traditional division into twelve articles:}}Pelbartus Ladislaus of Temesvxc3xa1r gives a slightly different division, assigning one phrase to each apostle: Peter (No.& 1), John (No.& 2), James, son of Zebedee (No.& 3), Andrew (No.& 4), Philip (No.& 5a: descendit ad infernos...), Thomas (No.& 5b: ascendit ad caelos...), Bartholomew (No.& 6), Matthew (No.& 7), James, son of Alphaeus (No.& 8), Simon (No.& 9), Jude (No.& 10), Matthias (No.& 11xe2x80x9312).In the Church of England there are currently two authorized forms of the creed: that of the Book of Common Prayer (1662) and that of Common Worship (2000).Book of Common Prayer, 1662The publication Evangelical Lutheran Worship published by Augsburg Fortress, is the primary worship resource for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada.The French composer Le Brung published one Latin setting in 1540, and the Spanish composer Fernando de las Infantas published two in 1578.Martin Luther wrote the hymn "Wir glauben all an einen Gott" (translated into Engish as "We all believe in one God") in 1524 as a paraphrase of the Apostles' Creed.In 1957, William P. Latham wrote "Credo (Metrical Version of the Apostlexe2x80x99s Creed)" in an SATB arrangement suitable for boys' and men's voices.In 1979 John Michael Talbot, a Third Order Franciscan, composed and recorded "Creed" on his album, The Lord's Supper.In 1986 Graham Kendrick published the popular "We believe in God the Father", closely based on the Apostles' Creed.The song "Creed" on Petra's 1990 album Beyond Belief is loosely based on the Apostles' Creed.GIA Publications published a hymn text in 1991 directly based on the Apostles' Creed, called "I Believe in God Almighty." </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> after Peter signed the Henoticon and was recognised by Zeno as the legitimate patriarch of Alexandria by which they were "deprived of their head".The condemnation of Eutyches irritated the rigid Monophysites; the equivocal attitude taken towards the Council of Chalcedon appeared to them insufficient, and many of them, especially the monks, deserted Peter, preferring to be without a head, rather than remain in communion with him.Later, they joined the adherents of the non-Chalcedonian Patriarch Severus of Antioch.They were, according to Oxford English Dictionary Online, a "group of extreme Monophysites" and "were absorbed by the Jacobites".Liberatus of Carthage wrote, in , that those at the Council of Ephesus who followed neither Patriarch Cyril I of Alexandria nor Patriarch John I of Antioch were called .Esaianites were one of the sects into which the Alexandrian  separated at the end of the 5th century. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, Guthrie has stated in multiple interviews that the song is more an "anti-stupidity" song than an anti-war song, adding that it is based on a true incident."Alice's Restaurant" was the song that earned Guthrie his first recording contract, after counterculture radio host Bob Fass began playing a tape recording of one of Guthrie's live performances of the song repeatedly one night in 1967.For a short period after its release in October 1967, "Alice's Restaurant" was heavily played on U.S. college and counterculture radio stations.The part of his father Woody Guthrie, who had died in 1967, was played by actor Joseph Boley; Alice, who made a cameo appearance as an extra, was also recast, with actress Pat Quinn in the title roleDespite its popularity, the song "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" is not always featured on the setlist of any given Guthrie performance. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> By the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at Zwickau in Germany.16th-century technical writers such as Biringuccio, Ercker and Agricola described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added.Eventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be alloyed with copper to make brass, a process known as speltering, However some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 Wightman brass memorial plaque from England may have been made by alloying copper with zinc and include traces of cadmium similar to those found in some zinc ingots from China. However, the cementation process was not abandoned, and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of solid-state cementation in a domed furnace at around 900xe2x80x93950& xc2xb0C and lasting up to 10 hours.In 1738 Nehemiah's son William Champion patented a technique for the first industrial scale distillation of metallic zinc known as distillation per descencum or "the English process". Diagnostic Medicine</ref>}} 'However, isolated examples of copper-zinc alloys are known in China from as early as the 5th millennium BC.The compositions of these early "brass" objects are highly variable and most have zinc contents of between 5% and 15% wt which is lower than in brass produced by cementation.By the 8thxe2x80x937th century BC Assyrian cuneiform tablets mention the exploitation of the "copper of the mountains" and this may refer to "natural" brass.By the first century BC brass was available in sufficient supply to use as coinage in Phrygia and Bithynia, Brass was produced by the cementation process where copper and zinc ore are heated together until zinc vapor is produced which reacts with the copper.However, if brass is placed in contact with a more noble metal such as silver or gold in such an environment, the brass will corrode galvanically; conversely, if brass is in contact with a less-noble metal such as zinc or iron, the less noble metal will corrode and the brass will be protected.To enhance the machinability of brass, lead is often added in concentrations of around 2%. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A number of non-official minority languages are spoken as well.As no census exists, there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium's three official languages or their dialects.The total number of native Dutch speakers is estimated to be about 6.23& million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while native French speakers number 3.32& million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (or 85%) in the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region.Both Belgian Dutch and Belgian French have minor differences in vocabulary and semantic nuances from the varieties spoken respectively in the Netherlands and France.Ilya Prigogine (Universitxc3xa9 libre de Bruxelles) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977.As of 1 January 2020, the total population of Belgium according to its population register was 11,492,641.In 2017 the average total fertility rate (TFR) across Belgium was 1.64 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 4.87 children born per woman in 1873., nearly 92% of the population had Belgian citizenship,At the beginning of 2012, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed around 25% of the total population i.e.The reunification of the Low Countries as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands occurred at the dissolution of the First French Empire in 1814, after the abdication of Napoleon.In 1830, the Belgian Revolution led to the separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially French-speaking and neutral, independent Belgium under a provisional government and a national congress.The main political parties of the 19th century were the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party, with the Belgian Labour Party emerging towards the end of the 19th century.Intercommunal tensions rose and the constitution was amended to minimize the potential for conflict.Based on the four language areas defined in 1962xe2x80x9363 (the Dutch, bilingual, French and German language areas), consecutive revisions of the country's constitution in 1970, 1980, 1988 and 1993 established a unique form of a federal state with segregated political power into three levels:The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region.The country emerged in 1830 following the Belgian Revolution, when it seceded from the Netherlands.Belgium participated in the Industrial RevolutionBelgium is one of the six founding countries of the European Union and its capital, Brussels, hosts the official seats of the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Council, as well as one of two seats of the European Parliament (the other being Strasbourg).With the possible exception of the Prime Minister, the Council of Ministers is composed of an equal number of Dutch-speaking members and French-speaking members.Belgium's political institutions are complex; most political power is organized around the need to represent the main cultural communities.The major parties in each community, though close to the political center, belong to three main groups: Christian Democrats, Liberals, and Social Democrats.The government led by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 to 2007 achieved a balanced budget, some tax reforms, a labor-market reform, scheduled nuclear phase-out and instigated legislation allowing more stringent war crime and more lenient soft drug usage prosecution. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Eric Clapton, known for his performances with the Blues Breakers and Cream, made a comeback in the 1990s with his album Unplugged, in which he played some standard blues numbers on acoustic guitar.However, beginning in the 1990s, digital multitrack recording and other technological advances and new marketing strategies including video clip production increased costs, challenging the spontaneity and improvisation that are an important component of blues music.In the 1980s and 1990s, blues publications such as Living Blues and Blues Revue were launched, major cities began forming blues societies, outdoor blues festivals became more common, andIn the 1990s, the largely ignored hill country blues gained minor recognition in both blues and alternative rock music circles with northern Mississippi artists R. L. Burnside and Junior Kimbrough.Blues musical styles, forms (12-bar blues), melodies, and the blues scale have influenced many other genres of music, such as rock and roll, jazz, and popular music.Blues subgenres include country blues, such as Delta blues and Piedmont blues, as well as urban blues styles such as Chicago blues and West Coast blues.Many blues musicians based in Memphis moved to Chicago in the late 1930s or early 1940s and became part of the urban blues movement.City or urban blues styles were more codified and elaborate, as a performer was no longer within their local, immediate community, and had to adapt to a larger, more varied audience's aesthetic.In 1920 the vaudeville singer Lucille Hegamin became the second black woman to record blues when she recorded "The Jazz Me Blues",Urban male performers included popular black musicians of the era, such as Tampa Red, Big Bill Broonzy and Leroy Carr. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Whorf's most elaborate argument for the existence of linguistic relativity was based on what he saw as a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi.Linguist Ekkehart Malotki challenged Whorf's analyses of Hopi temporal expressions and concepts with numerous examples how the Hopi language refers to time.Malotki's critique was widely cited as the final piece of evidence in refuting Whorf's ideas and his concept of linguistic relativity while other scholars defended the analysis of Hopi, arguing that Whorf's claim was not that Hopi lacked words or categories to describe temporality, but that the Hopi concept of time is altogether different from that of English speakers.Whorf's distinction between "overt" (phenotypical) and "covert" (cryptotypical) grammatical categories has become widely influential in linguistics and anthropology.Several studies from that period refuted Whorf's hypothesis, demonstrating that linguistic diversity is a surface veneer that masks underlying universal cognitive principles.By the 1960s analytical philosophers also became aware of the Sapirxe2x80x93Whorf hypothesis, and philosophers such as Max Black and Donald DavidsonEric Lenneberg, Noam Chomsky,Today many followers of universalist schools of thought continue to oppose the idea of linguistic relativity, seeing it as unsound or even ridiculous.Linguistic relativity studies have experienced a resurgence since the 1990s, and a series of favorable experimental results have brought Whorfianism back into favor, especially in cultural psychology and linguistic anthropology.In 1996 Penny Lee's reappraisal of Whorf's writings was published,In turn universalist scholars frequently dismiss as "dull"Whorf's views have been compared to those of philosophers such as Friedrich NietzscheWhorf is best known as the main proponent of what he called the principle of linguistic relativity, but which is often known as "the Sapirxe2x80x93Whorf hypothesis", named for him and Edward Sapir.But because Whorf, in his articles, gave specific examples of how he saw the grammatical categories of specific languages related to conceptual and behavioral patterns, he pointed towards an empirical research program that has been taken up by subsequent scholars, and which is often called "Sapirxe2x80x93Whorf studies".Whorf and Sapir both drew explicitly on Albert Einstein's principle of general relativity; hence linguistic relativity refers to the concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made.Whorf was also influenced by gestalt psychology, believing that languages require their speakers to describe the same events as different gestalt constructions, which he called "isolates from experience".If read superficially, some of Whorf's statements lend themselves to the interpretation that he supported linguistic determinism. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning.Bill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations,The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004.In the early 2000s, Clinton took flights on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet in connection with Clinton Foundation work.On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.Bill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.Clinton was selected as Time "Man of the Year" in 1992,In 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross "for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010".In November 1995, Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit Northern Ireland, seeing both the divided communities of Belfast and later famously handshaking Adams, 14 months into an IRA ceasefire during the Troubles.In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8million (equivalent to $& million in ) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden's death in 2011).In the midst of a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force.In Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons:Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993Along with his two Supreme Court appointments, Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts.president Barack Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.William S. Cohen presents President Clinton the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service.jpg|Secretary of Defense Cohen presents President Clinton the DoD Medal for Distinguished Public Service.Bill_Clinton_Statue_in_Ballybunion.JPG|Bill Clinton statue in Ballybunion, erected to commemorate his 1998 golfing visitBill Clinton statue.jpg|Bill Clinton statue in Pristina, the capital of KosovoBill Clinton is one of the narrators on Wolf Tracks and Peter and the Wolf, a 2003 recording of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf performed by the Russian National Orchestra, on Pentatone, together with Mikhail Gorbachev and Sophia Loren. The audiobook edition of his autobiography, My Life, read by Clinton himself, won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word AlbumClinton has two more Grammy nominations for his audiobooks: Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World in 2007 and Back to Work in 2012.}}}}  'Clinton announced three new initiatives: creating a special working group to coordinate AIDS research throughout the Federal government; convening public health experts to develop an action plan that integrates HIV prevention with substance abuse prevention; and launching a new effort by the Justice Department to ensure that health care facilities provide equal access to people with HIV and AIDS.On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996.Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated "bad journalism", and that "the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives".On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.A speech delivered by President Bill Clinton at the December 6, 1995 White House Conference on HIV/AIDS projected that a cure for AIDS and a vaccine to prevent further infection would be developed. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, since 2018, the ruling government and the President of Poland has signed a law that restricts store trading from 1st March 2018 to the first and last Sunday of the month, Palm Sunday, the 3rd and 4th Advent Sundays, as well as trading until 14.00 for Easter Saturday and Christmas Eve.This will change in 2019 to trading permitted solely on the last Sunday of the month, as well as Palm Sunday, the 3rd and 4th Advent Sundays, as well as trading until 14.00 for Easter Saturday and Christmas Eve.From 2020, stores may only be open on 7 Sundays in the year: Palm Sunday, the 3rd and 4th Advent Sundays, the last Sunday of January, April, June and August as well as trading until 14.00 for Easter Saturday and Christmas Eve.In Specht v. Commonwealth (Pa. 1848), for example, German Seventh Day Baptists in Pennsylvania employed attorney Thaddeus Stevens to challenge the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's Sunday law.The Supreme Court of the United States held in its landmark case, McGowan v. Maryland (1961), that Maryland's blue laws violated neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.McGowan was but one of four Sunday closing cases decided together by the Court in May of 1961. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b'      DESCRIPTION: Alcoholic drink made from fermented cereal grains.Beer is one of the oldestSome of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours,Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals, as well as a rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games.In early forms of English, and in the Scandinavian languages, the usual word for beer was the word whose Modern English form is ale.The word beer comes into present-day English from Old English bxc4x93or, itself from Common Germanic; although the word is not attested in the East Germanic branch of the language-family, it is found throughout the West Germanic and North Germanic dialects (modern Dutch and German bier, Old Norse bjxc3xb3rr).Most drinkers prefer pale lager to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength pale ale to be served cool, while a strong barley wine or imperial stout to be served at room temperature.Beer writer Michael Jackson proposed a five-level scale for serving temperatures: well chilled () for "light" beers (pale lagers); chilled () for Berliner Weisse and other wheat beers; lightly chilled () for all dark lagers, altbier and German wheat beers; cellar temperature () for regular British ale, stout and most Belgian specialities; and room temperature () for strong dark ales (especially trappist beer) and barley wine.Drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial refrigeration and by the 1870s, was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager.Beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels, such as a glass, a beer stein, a mug, a pewter tankard, a beer bottle or a can; or at music festivals and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup.Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer); A relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.Beer is considered to be a social lubricant in many societiesA study published in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result.The shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style.A beer tower is a beer dispensing device, usually found in bars and pubs, that consists of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, when this storage space is filled and the corresponding content is optimally compressed, this only represents 295 exabytes of information.Certain bitwise computer processor instructions (such as bit set) operate at the level of manipulating bits rather than manipulating data interpreted as an aggregate of bits.In the 1980s, when bitmapped computer displays became popular, some computers provided specialized bit block transfer instructions to set or copy the bits that corresponded to a given rectangular area on the screen.In most computers and programming languages, when a bit within a group of bits, such as a byte or word, is referred to, it is usually specified by a number from 0 upwards corresponding to its position within the byte or word.It may be physically implemented with a two-state device.The symbol for the binary digit is either bit per recommendation by the IEC 80000-13:2008 standard, or the lowercase character b, as recommended by the IEEE 1541-2002 and IEEE Std 260.1-2004 standards.A contiguous group of binary digits is commonly called a bit string, a bit vector, or a one- or more-dimensional bit array.A group of eight binary digits is called one& byte, but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Thin films of boron nitride can be obtained by chemical vapor deposition from boron trichloride and nitrogen precursors.Boron nitride reacts with iodine fluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at xe2x88x9230& xc2xb0C to produce an extremely sensitive contact explosive, NI, in low yield.Boron nitride reacts with nitrides of alkali metals and lanthanides to form nitridoborate compounds.Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods as that of diamond: Cubic boron nitride is produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite.It sublimates at 2973& xc2xb0C at normal pressure releasing nitrogen gas and boron, but melts at elevated pressure.Thermal stability of c-BN can be summarized as follows:Boron nitride is insoluble in the usual acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na, which are therefore used to etch BN.The theoretical thermal conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700xe2x80x932000 W/(mxc2xb7K), which has the same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for graphene, and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons.In 2009, a naturally occurring boron nitride mineral in the cubic form (c-BN) was reported in Tibet, with a proposed name of qingsongite.This ability of c-BN and h-BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.Similar to diamond, the combination in c-BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for heat spreaders.As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically and mechanically, it is one of the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.Layers of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) are used in some semiconductor devices, e.g. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It was followed by two other Henning-inspired "country cousin" series on CBS: Petticoat Junction and its spin-off Green Acres, which reversed the rags-to-riches, country-to-city model of The Beverly Hillbillies.The Beverly Hillbillies ranked among the top 20 most-watched programs on television for eight of its nine seasons, twice ranking as the number one series of the year, with 16 episodes that remain among the 100 most-watched television episodes in history.The series starts with Jed Clampett, an impoverished and widowed hillbilly living alongside an oil-rich swamp with his daughter and mother-in-law, discovering oil while shooting at a rabbit.("mountain doctor"), Granny uses her "white lightning" brew as a form of anesthesia when commencing painful treatments such as leech bleeding and using pliers for teeth-pulling.Paul Henning discarded the idea of making Granny Jed's mother, which would have changed the show's dynamics, making Granny the matriarch and Jed her subordinate. Elly May (portrayed by Donna Douglas in all 274 episodes), the only child of Jed and Rose Ellen Clampett, is a mountain beauty with the body of a pin-up girl and the soul of a tomboy.A limited number of episodes from the earlier portions of the series run have turned up in the public domain and as such are seen occasionally on many smaller networks such as Retro TV and MyFamily TV.MeTV Network airs The Beverly Hillbillies Monday-Saturday at 7 A.M.The show is distributed by CBS Television Distribution, the syndication arm of CBS Television Studios and the CBS network. </my-abstract>

10px"The population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8& million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5& million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1& million inhabitants.The first census in Brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478.In 2008, the illiteracy rate was 11.48%According to the National Research by Household Sample (PNAD) of 2008, 48.43% of the population (about 92 million) described themselves as White; 43.80% (about 83 million) as Pardo (brown), 6.84% (about 13 million) as Black; 0.58% (about 1.1& million) as Asian; and 0.28% (about 536 thousand) as Amerindian (officially called indxc3xadgena, Indigenous), while 0.07% (about 130 thousand) did not declare their race.In 2007, the National Indian Foundation estimated that Brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes, up from their estimate of 40 in 2005.Slavery among the Indians had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations.The land now called Brazil was claimed for the Portuguese Empire on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro xc3x81lvares Cabral.However, the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the Governorate General of Brazil in the city of Salvador, which became the capital of a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America.Portuguese expeditions known as Bandeiras gradually advanced the Portugal colonial original frontiers in South America to approximately the current Brazilian borders.The Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of Portugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance, such as the Quilombo of Palmares,In late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent Joxc3xa3o, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro.With the end of the Peninsular War in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent Joxc3xa3o return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony.Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic.Brazil is classified as an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries.The word "Brazil" likely comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast.The official Portuguese name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the "Land of the Holy Cross" (Terra da Santa Cruz),In the Guarani language, an official language of Paraguay, Brazil is called "Pindorama".By 2010, the industry had recovered, and arrivals grew above 2006 levels to 5.2& million international visitors, and receipts from these visitors reached US$6& billion.Despite continuing record-breaking international tourism revenues, the number of Brazilian tourists travelling overseas has been growing steadily since 2003, resulting in a net negative foreign exchange balance, as more money is spent abroad by Brazilians than comes in as receipts from international tourists visiting Brazil.Tourism expenditures abroad grew from US$5.8& billion in 2006, to US$8.2& billion in 2007, a 42% increase, representing a net deficit of US$3.3& billion in 2007, as compared to US$1.5& billion in 2006, a 125% increase from the previous year.In 2005, tourism contributed with 3.2% of the country's revenues from exports of goods and services, and represented 7% of direct and indirect employment in the Brazilian economy.In 1821, acceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of Porto,Tensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased, and the Portuguese Cortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.The Brazilian War of Independence, which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province.On 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberal and conservative sides of politics, including an attempt of republican secession, and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in Portugal had given in the succession of King John VI, Pedro& I went to Portugal to reclaim his daughter's crown, abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (who thus became the Empire's second monarch, with the royal title of Dom Pedro& II).As the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he came of age, a regency was set up by the National Assembly.Greater Rio de Janeiro, not including the city proper, is the most irreligious and least Roman Catholic Brazilian periphery, while Greater Porto Alegre and Greater Fortaleza are on the opposite sides of the lists, respectively.The official language of Brazil is PortugueseBrazilian Portuguese has had its own development, mostly similar to 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European PortugueseIn 1990, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), which included representatives from all countries with Portuguese as the official language, reached an agreement on the reform of the Portuguese orthography to unify the two standards then in use by Brazil on one side and the remaining lusophone countries on the other.In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real,The peaceful transition of power from Cardoso to his main opposition leader, Luiz Inxc3xa1cio Lula da Silva (elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006), was seen as proof that Brazil had achieved a long-sought political stability.Enhanced by political and economic crises with evidence of involvement by politicians from all the primary political parties in several bribery and tax evasion schemes, Through the Operation Car Wash, the Federal Police of Brazil has since acted on the deviations and corruption of the PT and allied parties at that time.Brazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent's interior, sharing land borders with Uruguay to the south; Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest; Bolivia and Peru to the west; Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and France (French overseas region of French Guiana) to the north.Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels.In addition, Brazil manages a peacekeeping mission in Haiti ($350& million) and makes in-kind contributions to the World Food Programme ($300& million).In Brazil, the Constitution establishes five different police agencies for law enforcement: Federal Police Department, Federal Highway Police, Federal Railroad Police, Military Police and Civil Police. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Black Sea undersea river is a current of particularly saline water flowing through the Bosporus Strait and along the seabed of the Black Sea, the first of its kind discovered.The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Black Sea as follows:Exclusive economic zones in Black Sea (Include Sea of Azov):Coastline length in Black Sea (Include Sea of Azov):Black Sea Basin countries, 2 million square kilometre basin and 25 countries:# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Note: In some sources, Armenia is also considered.Largest bays on the Black Sea:# Karkinit Bay, # Burgas Bay, # Dnieprovski Bay, # Dniestrovski Bay, # Sinop Bay, # Samsun Bay, Largest rivers flowing into the Black Sea:# Danube# Dnieper# Don# Dniester# Kuban# Southern Bug# Rioni# Kxc4xb1zxc4xb1lxc4xb1rmak# KamchiyaThe Black Sea is divided into two depositional basinsxe2x80x94the Western Black Sea and Eastern Black Seaxe2x80x94separated by the Mid-Black Sea High, which includes the Andrusov Ridge, Tetyaev High, and Archangelsky High, extending south from the Crimean Peninsula.Additionally, an alien speciesxe2x80x94the warty comb jelly ()xe2x80x94was able to establish itself in the basin, exploding from a few individuals to estimated biomass of one billion metric tons.File:black sea fauna jelly 01.jpg|JellyfishFile:black sea fauna actinia 01.jpg|ActiniaFile:black sea fauna actinia 02.JPG|ActiniaFile:black sea fauna goby 01.jpg|GobyFile:black sea fauna stingray 01.jpg|StingrayFile:Black sea mullus barbatus ponticus 01.jpg|Goat fishFile:Black sea fauna hermit crab 01.jpg|Hermit crab, Diogenes pugilatorFile:Black sea fauna blue sponge.jpg|Blue spongeFile:Squalus acanthias2.jpg|Spiny dogfishFile:Black Sea fauna Seahorse.JPG|SeahorseFile:Kitesurfer and Dolphins Cropped.jpg|Black Sea Common Dolphins with a kite-surfer off SochiIn the past, the range of the Asiatic lion extended from South Asia to the Balkans, possibly up to the Danube.As a result of these characteristics the Black Sea has gained interest from the field of marine archaeology as ancient shipwrecks in excellent states of preservation have been discovered, such as the Byzantine wreck Sinop D, located in the anoxic layer off the coast of Sinop, Turkey.Modelling shows that, in the event of an asteroid impact on the Black Sea, the release of hydrogen sulfide clouds  would pose a threat to healthxe2x80x94and perhaps even lifexe2x80x94for people living on the Black Sea coast.During winter, strong wind promotes convective overturning and upwelling of nutrients, while high summer temperatures result in a marked vertical stratification and a warm, shallow mixed layer.In total, Black Sea's biodiversity contains around one-third of Mediterranean's and is experiencing natural and artificial invasions or Mediterranizations.The main phytoplankton groups present in the Black Sea are dinoflagellates, diatoms, coccolithophores and cyanobacteria.The land at the eastern end of the Black Sea, Colchis, (now Georgia), marked for the Greeks the edge of the known world.The steppes to the north of the Black Sea have been suggested as the original homeland () of the speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language, (PIE) the progenitor of the Indo-European language family, by some scholars such as Marija Gimbutas; others move the homeland further east towards the Caspian Sea, yet others to Anatolia.Greek presence in the Black Sea began at least as early as the 9th century BC with colonization of the Black Sea's southern coast.The lyuti zver (Old East Slavic for "fierce animal") that was encountered by Vladimir II Monomakh, Velikiy Kniaz of Kievan Rus' (which ranged to the Black Sea in the south),Short-term climatic variation in the Black Sea region is significantly influenced by the operation of the North Atlantic oscillation, the climatic mechanisms resulting from the interaction between the north Atlantic and mid-latitude air masses.Some islands in the Black sea belong to Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine:The Black Sea is connected to the World Ocean by a chain of two shallow straits, the Dardanelles and the Bosporus.This concentration of historical powers, combined with the preservative qualities of the deep anoxic waters of the Black Sea, has attracted increased interest from marine archaeologists who have begun to discover a large number of ancient ships and organic remains in a high state of preservation.According to NATO, the Black sea is a strategic corridor that provides smuggling channels for moving legal and illegal goods including drugs, radioactive materials, and counterfeit goods that can be used to finance terrorism.According to the International Transport Workers' Federation 2013 study, there were at least 30 operating merchant seaports in the Black Sea (including at least 12 in Ukraine).According to the International Transport Workers' Federation 2013 study, there were around 2,400 commercial vessels operating in the Black Sea.Anchovy: the Turkish commercial fishing fleet catches around 300,000 tons per year on average, and fishery carried out mainly in winter and the highest portion of the stock is caught between November and December.Since the 1980s, the Soviet Union started offshore drilling for petroleum in the sea's western portion (adjoining Ukraine's coast).There are also catastrophic scenarios, such as the "Black Sea deluge theory" put forward by William Ryan, Walter Pitman and Petko Dimitrov.The Black Sea deluge is a hypothesized catastrophic rise in the level of the Black Sea circa 5600 BC due to waters from the Mediterranean Sea breaching a sill in the Bosporus Strait.The sector is near where Romania has also found gas reserves.Current names of the sea are usually equivalents of the English name "Black Sea", including these given in the countries bordering the sea:, , or simply , , "Sea"Such names have not yet been shown conclusively to predate the 13th& century.In Greece, the historical name "Euxine Sea" holds a different meaning (see below), is still widely used:The principal Greek name Pxc3xb3ntos xc3x81xeinos is generally accepted to be a rendering of Iranian word  (dark colored), compare Avestan  (dark colored), Old Persian  (turquoise colored), Middle Persian / (blue), and New Persian  (blue), as well as Ossetic  (dark gray). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Groups within Christianity include differing books as part of their sacred writings, most prominent among which are the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books.Significant versions of the Christian Bible in English include the Douay-Rheims Bible, the Authorized King James Version, the Revised Version, the American Standard Version, the Revised Standard Version, the New American Standard Version, the New King James Version, the New International Version, the New American Bible, and the English Standard Version.The books which make up the Christian Old Testament differ between the Catholic (see Catholic Bible), Orthodox, and Protestant (see Protestant Bible) churches, with the Protestant movement accepting only those books contained in the Hebrew Bible, while Catholic and Orthodox traditions have wider canons.It defines the books of the Jewish canon, and also the precise letter-text of these biblical books, with their vocalization and accentuation.The oldest extant manuscripts of the Masoretic Text date from approximately the 9th century CE,The name Tanakh (Hebrew: ) reflects the threefold division of the Hebrew Scriptures, Torah ("Teaching"), Nevi'im ("Prophets") and Ketuvim ("Writings").The Torah (xd7xaaxd6xbcxd7x95xd6xb9xd7xa8xd6xb8xd7x94) is also known as the "Five Books of Moses" or the Pentateuch, meaning "five scroll-cases".Traditionally these books were considered to have been written almost entirely by Moses himself.In the 19th century, Julius Wellhausen and other scholars proposed that the Torah had been compiled from earlier written documents dating from the 9th to the 5th century BCE, the "documentary hypothesis".The Hebrew names of the books are derived from the first words in the respective texts.However, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.The Roman Catholic Church recognizes:Canon of Trent: List of the Canonical Scriptures.In addition to those, the Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches recognize the following: Russian and Georgian Orthodox Churches include:There is also 4 Maccabees which is only accepted as canonical in the Georgian Church, but was included by St. Jerome in an appendix to the Vulgate, and is an appendix to the Greek Orthodox Bible, and it is therefore sometimes included in collections of the Apocrypha.The Syriac Orthodox tradition includes:The Ethiopian Biblical canon includes:and some other books.The Anglican Church uses some of the Apocryphal books liturgically, though rarely and with alternative reading available.Second, the Hebrew source texts used for the Septuagint differed from the Masoretic tradition of Hebrew texts, which was chosen as canonical by the Jewish rabbis.Finally, the rabbis claimed a divine authority for the Hebrew language, in contrast to Aramaic or Greek xe2x80x93 even though these languages were the lingua franca of Jews during this period (and Aramaic would eventually be given a holy language status comparable to Hebrew).The Septuagint is the basis for the Old Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Old Armenian, Old Georgian and Coptic versions of the Christian Old Testament.In most ancient copies of the Bible which contain the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, the Book of Daniel is not the original Septuagint version, but instead is a copy of Theodotion's translation from the Hebrew, which more closely resembles the Masoretic Text.It gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (biblia, gen. bibliae) in medieval Latin, and so the word was loaned as singular into the vernaculars of Western Europe.The English word Bible is from the Latin , from the same word in Medieval Latin and Late Latin and ultimately from  "the books" (singular ).By the 2nd century BCE, Jewish groups began calling the books of the Bible the "scriptures" and they referred to them as "holy", or in Hebrew xd7x9bxd6xb4xd6xbcxd7xaaxd6xb0xd7x91xd6xb5xd7x99 xd7x94xd6xb7xd7xa7xd6xb9xd6xbcxd7x93xd6xb6xd7xa9xd7x81 (Kitvei hakkodesh), and Christians now commonly call the Old and New Testaments of the Christian Bible "The Holy Bible" (in Greek , ) or "the Holy Scriptures" (, ).With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time.The Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon xe2x80x93 the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division xe2x80x93 while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament.These books can be grouped into:The GospelsNarrative literature, account and history of the Apostolic agePauline EpistlesPastoral epistlesGeneral epistles, also called catholic epistlesApocalyptic literature, also called PropheticalThe New Testament books are ordered differently in the Catholic/Orthodox/Protestant tradition, the Slavonic tradition, the Syriac tradition and the Ethiopian tradition.The mainstream consensus is that the New Testament was written in a form of Koine Greek, from the Conquests of Alexander the Great (335xe2x80x93323 BCE) until the evolution of Byzantine Greek (c. 600).The original autographs, that is, the original Greek writings and manuscripts written by the original authors of the New Testament, have not survived. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Notably, the Tsilhqot'in Nation has established Aboriginal title to a portion of their territory, as a result of the 2014 Supreme Court of Canada decision in Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia.The province's name was chosen by Queen Victoria, when the Colony of British Columbia (1858xe2x80x931866), i.e., "the Mainland", became a British colony in 1858.Ultimately, the Columbia in the name British Columbia is derived from the name of the Columbia Rediviva, an American ship which lent its name to the Columbia River and later the wider region;British Columbia is bordered to the west by the Pacific Ocean and the American state of Alaska, to the north by Yukon and the Northwest Territories, to the east by the province of Alberta, and to the south by the American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana.BC was the largest net recipient of interprovincial migrants in Canada in the first quarter of 2016 with half of the 5,000 people coming from Alberta.With an estimated population of 5.1& million as of 2020, British Columbia is Canada's third-most populous province, after Ontario and Quebec.Half of all British Columbians live in the Metro Vancouver area, which includes Vancouver, Surrey, New Westminster, West Vancouver, North Vancouver (city), North Vancouver (district municipality), Burnaby, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Maple Ridge, Langley (city), Langley (district municipality), Delta, Pitt Meadows, White Rock, Richmond, Port Moody, Anmore, Belcarra, Lions Bay and Bowen Island, with adjacent unincorporated areas (including the University Endowment Lands) represented in the regional district as the electoral area known as Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A.Historically, there have commonly been third parties present in the legislature (including the Liberals themselves from 1952 to 1975); the BC Green Party are the current third party in British Columbia, with three seats in the legislature.Prior to the rise of the Liberal Party, British Columbia's main political party was the British Columbia Social Credit Party which ruled British Columbia for 20 continuous years.When news of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush reached London, Richard Clement Moody was hand-picked by the Colonial Office, under Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, to establish British order and to transform the newly established Colony of British Columbia into the British Empire's "bulwark in the farthest west" at the head of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment.Moody and his family arrived in British Columbia in December 1858, commanding the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment.Hours after that plan was unveiled in Ottawa on December 3, 2015, Clark issued a statement that it did "not address what's been wrong with the Senate since the beginning".The flag of British Columbia is not protected and is in the public domain, but the coat of arms is protected by law.British Columbia was the second Canadian jurisdiction (after Ontario) to legalize same-sex marriage.Housing affordability is of concern to British Columbians.In April 2016 the government of British Columbia declared a public health emergency due to overdoses on the illicit opioid Fentanyl.In 2007, a large maritime container port was opened in Prince Rupert with an inland sorting port in Prince George.There are over 200 airports throughout British Columbia, the major ones being the Vancouver International Airport, the Victoria International Airport, the Kelowna International Airport, and the Abbotsford International Airport, the first three of which each served over 1,000,000 passengers in 2005. , Vancouver International Airport is the 2nd busiest airport in the country and the second biggest International Gateway on the west coast (after Los Angeles) with an estimated 17.9& million travellers passing through in 2008.Given its varied mountainous terrain and its coasts, lakes, rivers, and forests, British Columbia has long been enjoyed for pursuits like hiking and camping, rock climbing and mountaineering, hunting and fishing.Water sports, both motorized and non-motorized, are enjoyed in many places. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The 19th-century German Sanskritist Theodor Goldstxc3xbccker was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the Vedanta tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was <blockquote>... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.</blockquote>Max Mxc3xbcller, in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying "the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'.Leibniz disagreed harshly with Spinoza in his own manuscript "Refutation of Spinoza," (as mentioned above), and his own work bears some striking resemblances to specific important parts of Spinoza's philosophy (see: Monadology).When the public reactions to the anonymously published Theologico-Political Treatise were extremely unfavourable to his brand of Cartesianism, Spinoza was compelled to abstain from publishing more of his works.Most of the community would have liked to have seen the ban lifted, but the rabbi of the congregation ruled that it should hold, on the basis that he had no greater wisdom than his predecessors, and that Spinoza's views had not become less problematic over time.Spinoza spent his remaining 21 years writing and studying as a private scholar.Spinoza believed in a "Philosophy of tolerance and benevolence" He spent a brief time in or near the village of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, but returned soon afterwards to Amsterdam and lived there quietly for several years, giving private philosophy lessons and grinding lenses, before leaving the city in 1660 or 1661.During this time in Amsterdam, Spinoza wrote his Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being, which he never published in his lifetimexe2x80x94assuming with good reason that it might get suppressed.Karl Marx liked Spinoza's account of the universe, interpreting it as materialistic.When George Santayana graduated from college, he published an essay, "The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza", in The Harvard Monthly.Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by G. E. Moore) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, an allusion to Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The unity of the whole being is actuated by another really distinct principle, the existence.If nature cannot err, then there are no paradoxes in it; to Hobbes, the paradox is a form of the absurd, which is inconsistency:<blockquote>"Yet they will have us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at one and the same time in many places [the problem of the universals]; and many bodies at one and the same time in one place [the whole and the parts]; ... And these are but a small part of the Incongruencies they are forced to, from their disputing philosophically, instead of admiring, and adoring of the Divine and Incomprehensible Nature ...."</blockquote>The real distinction between essence and existence, and that between form and matter, which served for so long as the basis of metaphysics, Hobbes identifies as "the Error of Separated Essences.An early professed empiricist, Thomas Hobbes, known as an eccentric denizen of the court of Charles II of England (an "old bear"), published in 1651 Leviathan, a political treatise written during the English Civil War, containing an early manifesto in English of rationalism.Hobbes said:<blockquote>"The Latines called Accounts of mony Rationes ... and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the word Ratio, to the faculty of Reckoning in all other things....When a man reasoneth hee does nothing else but conceive a summe totall ... For Reason ... is nothing but Reckoning ... of the consequences of generall names agreed upon, for the marking and signifying of our thoughts ...."</blockquote>In Hobbes reasoning is the right process of drawing conclusions from definitions (the "names agreed upon"). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The land forces consist of two mechanized brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems in six air bases, and the navy operates various ships, helicopters and coastal defence weapons.A balanced budget was achieved in 2003 and the country began running a surplus the following year.The Yugozapaden planning area is the most developed region with a per capita gross domestic product (PPP) of $29,816 in 2018.After several consecutive years of high growth, repercussions of the financial crisis of 2007xe2x80x932008 resulted in a 3.6% contraction of GDP in 2009 and increased unemployment.Siphoning of public funds to the families and relatives of politicians from incumbent parties has resulted in fiscal and welfare losses to society.Ethnic groups in Inner Asia with phonologically similar names were frequently described in similar terms: during the 4th century, the Buluoji, a component of the "Five Barbarian" groups in Ancient China, were portrayed as both a "mixed race" and "troublemakers".Neanderthal remains dating to around 150,000 years ago, or the Middle Paleolithic, are some of the earliest traces of human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria.The Thracians, one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians, appeared on the Balkan Peninsula some time before the 12th century BC.By the end of the 1st century AD, Roman governance was established over the entire Balkan Peninsula and Christianity began spreading in the region around the 4th century.It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929,The left-wing coup d'xc3xa9tat of 9 September 1944 led to the abolition of the monarchy and the executions of some 1,000xe2x80x933,000 dissidents, war criminals, and members of the former royal elite.The Communist Party was forced to give up its political monopoly on 10 November 1989 under the influence of the Revolutions of 1989. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Nucleating on an empty gastropod shell, the bryozoan colonies form multilamellar skeletal crusts that produce spherical encrustations and extend the living chamber of the hermit crab through helicospiral tubular growth.Some phylactolaemate species are intermediate hosts for a group of myxozoa that have also been found to cause proliferative kidney disease, which is often fatal in salmonid fish, and has severely reduced wild fish populations in Europe and North America.Membranipora membranacea, whose colonies feed and grow exceptionally fast in a wide range of current speeds, was first noticed in the Gulf of Maine in 1987 and quickly became the most abundant organism living on kelps.Fish farms and hatcheries have lost stock to  proliferative kidney disease, which is caused by one or more myxozoans that use bryozoans as alternate hosts.Some fishermen in the North Sea have had to find other work because of a form of eczema (a skin disease) known as "Dogger Bank itch",Marine bryozoans are often responsible for biofouling on ships' hulls, on docks and marinas, and on offshore structures.Traditional phylogeny, based on anatomy and on the development of the adult forms from embryos, has produced no enduring consensus about the position of ectoprocts.When entoprocts were discovered in the 19th& century, they and bryozoans (ectoprocts) were regarded as classes within the phylum Bryozoa, because both groups were sessile animals that filter-fed by means of a crown of tentacles that bore cilia.From 1869 onwards increasing awareness of differences, including the position of the entoproct anus inside the feeding structure and the difference in the early pattern of division of cells in their embryos, caused scientists to regard the two groups as separate phyla,However, two well-known zoologists, Claus Nielsen and Thomas Cavalier-Smith, maintain on anatomical and developmental grounds that bryozoans and entoprocts are member of the same phylum, Bryozoa.Marine fossils from the Paleozoic era, which ended , are mainly of erect forms, those from the Mesozoic are fairly equally divided by erect and encrusting forms, and more recent ones are predominantly encrusting.Scientists are divided about whether the Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) are a monophyletic group (whether they include all and only a single ancestor species and all its descendants), about what are the phylum's closest relatives in the family tree of animals, and even about whether they should be regarded as members of the protostomes or deuterostomes, the two major groups that account for all moderately complex animals.Molecular phylogeny, which attempts to work out the evolutionary family tree of organisms by comparing their biochemistry and especially their genes, has done much to clarify the relationships between the better-known invertebrate phyla.Research from the 1970s onwards suggested they were deuterostomes, because of some features that were thought characteristic of deuterostomes: a three-part coelom; radial rather than spiral cleavage in the development of the embryo;Molecular phylogeny analyses from 1995 onwards, using a variety of biochemical evidence and analytical techniques, placed the lophophorates as protostomes and closely related to annelids and molluscs in a super-phylum called Lophotrochozoa.A study of the mitochondrial DNA sequence suggests that the Bryozoa may be related to the Chaetognatha.Most species are filter feeders that sieve small particles, mainly phytoplankton (microscopic floating plants), out of the water.In some species the first part of the stomach forms a muscular gizzard lined with chitinous teeth that crush armored prey such as diatoms. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> During the early 1990s, there were a number of mid-sized software companies dedicated to BBS software, and the number of BBSes in service reached its peak.Towards the early 1990s, the BBS industry became so popular that it spawned three monthly magazines, Boardwatch, BBS Magazine, and in Asia and Australia, Chips 'n Bits Magazine which devoted extensive coverage of the software and technology innovations and people behind them, and listings to US and worldwide BBSes.The owner of textfiles.com, Jason Scott, also produced BBS: The Documentary, a DVD film that chronicles the history of the BBS and features interviews with well-known people (mostly from the United States) from the heyday BBS era.In the 2000s, most traditional BBS systems migrated to the Internet using Telnet or SSH protocols.The development of ANSI art became so popular that it spawned an entire BBS "artscene" subculture devoted to it.The Amiga Skyline BBS software was the first in 1987 featuring a script markup language communication protocol called Skypix which was capable of giving the user a complete graphical interface, featuring rich graphic content, changeable fonts, mouse-controlled actions, animations and sound.Today, most BBS software that is still actively supported, such as Worldgroup, Wildcat! </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This role is filled by tactical bomber class, which crosses and blurs with various other aircraft categories: light bombers, medium bombers, dive bombers, interdictors, fighter-bombers, attack aircraft, multirole combat aircraft, and others.The first use of an air-dropped bomb (actually four hand grenades specially manufactured by the Italian naval arsenal) was carried out by Italian Second Lieutenant Giulio GavottiOn 16 October 1912, observer Prodan Tarakchiev dropped two of those bombs on the Turkish railway station of Karaxc4x9faxc3xa7 (near the besieged Edirne) from an Albatros F.2 aircraft piloted by Radul Milkov, for the first time in this campaign.The aircraft was purchased for use both by the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), and three T.B.8s, that were being displayed in Paris during December 1913 fitted with bombing equipment, were sent to France following the outbreak of war.World War II saw the beginning of the widespread use of high speed bombers which dispensed with defensive weapons to be able to attain higher speed, such as with the de Havilland Mosquito, a philosophy that continued with many Cold War bombers.Some smaller designs have been used as the basis for night fighters, and a number of fighters, such as the Hawker Hurricane were used as ground attack aircraft, replacing earlier conventional light bombers that proved unable to defend themselves while carrying a useful bomb load.At the start of the Cold War, bombers were the only means of carrying nuclear weapons to enemy targets, and had the role of deterrence. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In colloquial usage, the term billiards may be used to refer to pocket billiards games, such as pool, snooker, or Russian pyramid.There are 3 major subdivisions of games within cue sports:There are other variants that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games played with disks instead of balls.Billiards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the body of Mary, Queen of Scots, in her billiard table cover in 1586, through its many mentions in the works of Shakespeare, including the famous line "let's to billiards" in Antony and Cleopatra (1606xe2x80x9307), and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as: Mozart, Louis XIV of France, Marie Antoinette, Immanuel Kant, Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, George Washington, French president Jules Grxc3xa9vy, Charles Dickens, George Armstrong Custer, Theodore Roosevelt, Lewis Carroll, W.C.& Fields, Babe Ruth, Bob Hope, and Jackie Gleason.Billiards in the 1620s was played with a "port", a "king" pin, and maces.All cue sports are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stick-and-ball lawn games xe2x80x93 specifically those retroactively termed ground billiards xe2x80x93 and as such to be related to the historical games jeu de mail and palle-malle, and modern trucco, croquet, and golf, and more distantly to the stickless bocce and bowls.The word billiard may have evolved from the French word billart or billette, meaning 'stick', in reference to the , an implement similar to a golf putter, and which was the forerunner to the modern cue; however, the term's origin could have been from French bille, meaning 'ball'.Skilled players may use more than one cue during a game, including a separate cue often with a hard phenolic resin tip for the opening break shot and another, shorter cue with a special tip for .Some players, especially current or former snooker players, use a screw-on cue butt extension instead of or in addition to the mechanical bridge.Bridge head design is varied, and not all designs (especially those with cue shaft-enclosing rings, or wheels on the bottom of the head), are broadly tournament-approved.In Italy a longer, thicker cue is typically available for this kind of tricky shot.For snooker they are normally available in three forms, their use depending on how the player is hampered; the standard rest is a simple cross, the 'spider' has a raised arch around 12& cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most awkward of shots, the 'giraffe' (or 'swan' in England) which has a raised arch much like the 'spider' but with a slender arm reaching out around 15& cm with the groove.Billiard chalk is applied to the tip of the cue.Chalk is applied to the [https://billiardguides.com/best-pool-cue-tips/ tip of the cue stick], ideally before every shot, to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit, no  (unintentional slippage between the cue tip and the struck ball) occurs.The early balls were made from wood and clay, but the rich preferred to use ivory.Early billiard games involved various pieces of additional equipment, including the "arch" (related to the croquet hoop), "port" (a different hoop) and "king" (a pin or skittle near the arch) in the 1770s, but other game variants, relying on the cushions (and eventually on pockets cut into them), were being formed that would go on to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards.Illustration of a three-ball pocket billiards game in early 19th century [[Txc3xbcbingen, Germany, using a table much longer than the modern type]]The early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of the carom or carambole billiards category xe2x80x93 what most non-Commonwealth and non-US speakers mean by the word billiards.Variations include straight rail, balkline, one-cushion, three-cushion, five-pins, and four-ball, among others.Over time, a type of obstacle returned, originally as a hazard and later as a target, in the form of pockets, or holes partly cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions, leading to the rise of pocket billiards, including "pool" games such as eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool and one-pocket; Russian pyramid; snooker; English billiards and others.In the United States pool and billiards had died out for a bit, but between 1878 and 1956 pool and billiards became very popular.Many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk or talc because of the messiness of these powders; buildup of particles on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth cleaning.Cue tip chalk (invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro William A. Spinks and chemist William Hoskins in 1897) into a powder.There are two main varieties of billiard games: carom and pocket.The main carom billiards games are straight rail, balkline and three cushion billiards. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Constitution of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the country's fundamental law, capitalises the "T" in "The Bahamas".The first inhabitants of The Bahamas were the Taino people, who moved into the uninhabited southern islands from Hispaniola and Cuba around the 800sxe2x80x931000s AD, having migrated there from South America; they came to be known as the Lucayan people.The total fertility rate is 2.0 children born/woman (2010).The most populous islands are New Providence, where Nassau, the capital and largest city, is located; Three centuries prior, in 1722 when the first official census of The Bahamas was taken, 74% of the population was native European and 26% native African.Since the colonial era of plantations, Africans or Afro-Bahamians have been the largest ethnic group in The Bahamas, whose primary ancestry was based in West Africa.In 1971, the UBP merged with a disaffected faction of the PLP to form a new party, the Free National Movement (FNM), a de-racialised, centre-right party which aimed to counter the growing power of Pindling's PLP.Hughes, C (1981) Race and Politics in the Bahamas  The British House of Lords voted to give The Bahamas its independence on 22 June 1973.Shortly after independence, The Bahamas joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on 22 August 1973,Politically, the first two decades were dominated by Pindling's PLP, who went on to win a string of electoral victories.Hurricane Dorian of 2019 passed over the archipelago at destructive Category& 5 strength with sustained winds of  and wind gusts up to , becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record to impact the northwestern islands of Grand Bahama and Great Abaco.}}The Bahamas is part of the Lucayan Archipelago, which continues into the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Mouchoir Bank, the Silver Bank, and the Navidad Bank.The Bahamas Platform, which includes The Bahamas, Southern Florida, Northern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos, and the Blake Plateau, formed about 150 Ma, not long after the formation of the North Atlantic.The first Africans to arrive to The Bahamas were freed slaves from Bermuda; they arrived with the Eleutheran Adventurers looking for new lives.The Haitian community in The Bahamas is also largely of African descent and numbers about 80,000. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The island is named for Michael Baker, who visited the island in 1834.The United States took possession of the island in 1857, claiming it under the Guano Islands Act of 1856.On February 27, 1869 the British ship Shaftsbury under Captain John Davies, which had arrived at Baker's Island on 5 February from Montevideo, was wrecked after being driven onto the reef by a sudden wind shift and squall from the northwest, dragging her moorings with her.On 7 December 1886, the American Guano Company sold all its rights to the British firm John T. Arundel and Company, which made the island its headquarters for guano digging operations in the Pacific from 1886 to 1891. </my-abstract>

Notable human rights organisations and initiatives include the Centre for Law and Mediation, Odhikar, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee.Successive governments and their security forces have flouted constitutional principles and have been accused of human rights abuses.The judiciary is often influenced by legal developments in the Commonwealth of Nations, such as the doctrine of legitimate expectation.The Bangladesh Armed Forces have inherited the institutional framework of the British military and the British Indian Army.The Bangladesh Navy has the third-largest fleet of countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal, including guided-missile frigates, submarines, cutters and aircraft.In 1615, the Portuguese Navy defeated a joint Dutch East India Company and Arakanese fleet near the coast of Chittagong.The Bengal Sultan after 1534 allowed the Portuguese to create several settlements at Chitagoong, Satgaon,In 1666, the Mughal government of Bengal led by viceroy Shaista Khan moved to retake Chittagong from Portuguese and Arakanese control.After the 1757 Battle of Plassey, Bengal was the first region of the Indian subcontinent conquered by the British East India Company. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The decreased appeal of an indenture on Barbados, combined with enormous demand for labour caused by sugar cultivation, led the use of involuntary transportation to Barbados as a punishment for crimes, or for political prisoners, and also to the kidnapping of labourers who were sent to Barbados involuntarily.The introduction of sugar cane from Dutch Brazil in 1640 completely transformed society, the economy and the physical landscape.The Democratic Labour Party government (DLP) held office with the then 1st Premier of Barbados became Prime Minister of Barbados, Errol Barrow for three successive terms from 4 December 1961 to 2 September 1976; and again from 28 May 1986 until his sudden death in office on 1 June 1987.It has hosted the Barbados Open on several occasions.Volleyball is also popular and is mainly played indoors.Tennis is gaining popularity and Barbados is home to Darian King, currently ranked 270th in the world and is the 2nd highest ranked player in the Caribbean.Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.As a wealthy sugar colony, it became an English centre of the African slave trade until that trade was outlawed by the Slave Trade Act 1807, with final emancipation of slaves in Barbados occurring over a period of years following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.On 30 November 1966, Barbados became an independent state and Commonwealth realm with Elizabeth II as its queen, though the country is set to remove her as its head of state and become a republic by 30 November 2021. or the Spanish equivalent, , both meaning "the bearded ones".The Barbados Labour Party government (BLP) held power with the now 8th Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley from 24 May 2018 to present until the next general election on 24 May 2023.Barbados follows a policy of nonalignment and seeks cooperative relations with all friendly states.Many initiatives to mitigate human pressures on the coastal regions of Barbados and seas come from the Coastal Zone Management Unit (CZMU).Although on the opposite side of the Atlantic, and some  west of Africa, Barbados is one of many places in the American continent that experience heightened levels of mineral dust from the Sahara Desert.Access to biocapacity in Barbados is much lower than world average.Furthermore, the island of Barbuda in the Leewards is very similar in name and was once named "" by the Spanish.The original name for Barbados in the Pre-Columbian era was , according to accounts by descendants of the indigenous Arawakan-speaking tribes in other regional areas, with possible translations including "Red land with white teeth"Colloquially, Barbadians refer to their home island as "Bim" or other nicknames associated with Barbados, including "Bimshire". </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Belarus was one of the world's most industrially developed states by percentage of GDP as well as the richest CIS member-state.In 2015, 39.3% of Belarusians were employed by state-controlled companies, 57.2% were employed by private companies (in which the government has a 21.1% stake) and 3.5% were employed by foreign companies.Economically, Belarus involved itself in the CIS, Eurasian Economic Community, and Union with Russia.In the 1990s, however, industrial production plunged due to decreases in imports, investment, and demand for Belarusian products from its trading partners.The labor force consists of more than four million people, among whom women hold slightly more jobs than men.The currency of Belarus is the Belarusian ruble.Under the 1994 constitution, the president could serve for only two terms as president, but a change in the constitution in 2004 eliminated term limits.The government includes a Council of Ministers, headed by the prime minister and five deputy prime ministers.Belarus's Democracy Index rating is the lowest in Europe, the country is labelled as "not free" by Freedom House, as "repressed" in the Index of Economic Freedom, and is rated as the worst country for press freedom in Europe in the 2013xe2x80x932014 Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, which ranks Belarus 157th out of 180 nations.Neither the pro-Lukashenko parties, such as the Belarusian Socialist Sporting Party and the Republican Party of Labour and Justice, nor the People's Coalition 5 Plus opposition parties, such as the Belarusian People's Front and the United Civil Party of Belarus, won any seats in the 2004 elections.Belarus is dependent on Russia for imports of raw materials and for its export market.The union of Russia and Belarus, a supranational confederation, was established in a 1996xe2x80x9399 series of treaties that called for monetary union, equal rights, single citizenship, and a common foreign and defense policy.On 11 December 2007, reports emerged that a framework for the new state was discussed between both countries.Belarus was a founding member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).Belarus is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer in economic and geopolitical terms.On 15 February 2016 the European Union announced the easing of sanctions against Belarus during a meeting by 28 EU foreign ministers at a regular session of the Council of the European Union.Belarus has not expressed a desire to join NATO but has participated in the Individual Partnership Program since 1997,Each region has a provincial legislative authority, called a region council (, ), which is elected by its residents, and a provincial executive authority called a region administration (, ), whose chairman is appointed by the president.Belarus declared itself sovereign on  1990 by issuing the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic.With the support of the Communist Party, the country's name was changed to the Republic of Belarus on  1991.A national constitution was adopted in March 1994 in which the functions of prime minister were given to the President of Belarus.Two-round elections for the presidency on ( 1994 and  1994) and Human Rights Watch have criticized Lukashenko's authoritarian style of government.Since 2014, following years of embrace of Russian influence in the country, Lukashenko has pressed a revival of Belarusian identity.Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including Kievan Rus', the Principality of Polotsk (11th to 14th centuries), the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polishxe2x80x93Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire.In the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution, different states arose competing for legitimacy amidst the Civil War, ultimately ending in the rise of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR) which became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922.The borders of the Byelorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn, in accord with the 1919-proposed Curzon Line.Joseph Stalin implemented a policy of Sovietization to isolate the Byelorussian SSR from Western influences.Soviet Belarusian communist politician Andrei Gromyko, who served as Soviet foreign minister (1957xe2x80x931985) and as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (1985xe2x80x931988), was responsible for many top decisions on Soviet foreign policy until he was replaced by Eduard Shevardnadze.In March 1990, elections for seats in the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR took place. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> "Kitchen Spanish" is an intermediate form of Spanish mixed with Belize Creole, spoken in the northern towns such as Corozal and San Pedro.Over half the population is multilingual.Belize is also home to three Maya languages: Q'eqchi', Mopan (an endangered language), and Yucatec Maya.Approximately 16,100 people speak the Arawakan-based Garifuna language,}}According to the 2010 census, 40.1% of Belizeans are Roman Catholics, 31.8% are Protestants (8.4% Pentecostal; 5.4% Adventist; 4.7% Anglican; 3.7% Mennonite; 3.6% Baptist; 2.9% Methodist; 2.8% Nazarene), 1.7% are Jehovah's Witnesses, 10.3% adhere to other religions (Maya religion, Garifuna religion, Obeah and Myalism, and minorities of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, Bahxc3xa1xcaxbcxc3xads, Rastafarians and other) and 15.5% profess to be irreligious.According to PROLADES, Belize was 64.6% Roman Catholic, 27.8% Protestant, 7.6% Other in 1971.In addition to Catholics, there has always been a large accompanying Protestant minority.Belize is the only continental Central American country which is a Commonwealth realm, with Queen Elizabeth II as its monarch and head of state, represented by a Governor General (currently, His Excellence Sir Colville Young).The earliest known record of the name "Belize" appears in the journal of the Dominican priest Fray Josxc3xa9 Delgado, dating to 1677.In the 1820s, the Creole elite of Belize invented the legend that the toponym Belize derived from the Spanish pronunciation of the name of a Scottish buccaneer, Peter Wallace, who established a settlement at the mouth of the Belize River in 1638.The recorded history of the middle and southern regions focuses on Caracol, an urban political centre that may have supported over 140,000 people.When Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, the area of present-day Belize included three distinct Maya territories:Spanish conquistadors explored the land and declared it part of the Spanish Empire but failed to settle it because of its lack of resources and the hostile tribes of the Yucatxc3xa1n.English pirates sporadically visited the coast of what is now Belize, seeking a sheltered region from which they could attack Spanish ships (see English settlement in Belize) and  cut logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum) trees.Of all the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Belize ranked 3rd from last and had the lowest female-to-male ratio for primary school enrolment., 48.3% of women in Belize participate in the workforce, compared to 81.8% of men.In Belizean folklore, there are the legends of Lang Bobi Suzi, La Llorona, La Sucia, Tata Duende, X'tabai, Anansi, Xtabay, Sisimite and the cadejo.Most of the public holidays in Belize are traditional Commonwealth and Christian holidays, although some are specific to Belizean culture such as Garifuna Settlement Day and Heroes and Benefactors' Day, formerly Baron Bliss Day.CARIFORUM presently the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the European Union.The British Army Garrison in Belize is used primarily for jungle warfare training, with access to over  of jungle terrain.After Belize achieved independence in 1981 the United Kingdom maintained a deterrent force (British Forces Belize) in the country to protect it from invasion by Guatemala (see Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory).The Belize Barrier Reef is a UNESCO-recognized World Heritage Site and is the second-largest barrier reef in the world, behind Australia's Great Barrier Reef.A remote sensing study conducted by the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC) and NASA, in collaboration with the Forest Department and the Land Information Centre (LIC) of the government of Belize's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment (MNRE), and published in August 2010 revealed that Belize's forest cover in early 2010 was approximately 62.7%, down from 75.9% in late 1980. each year.In 1842 Charles Darwin described it as "the most remarkable reef in the West Indies".The Belize Barrier Reef was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996 due to its vulnerability and the fact that it contains important natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biodiversity.The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world:With 90% of the reef still to be researched, some estimate that only 10% of all species have been discovered.Belize became the first country in the world to completely ban bottom trawling in December 2010. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The population is young, with a life expectancy of 62 years.Recent migrations have brought other African nationals to Benin that include Nigerians, Togolese, and Malians.In the 2013 census, 48.5% of the population of Benin were Christian (25.5% Roman Catholic, 6.7% Celestial Church of Christ, 3.4% Methodist, 12.9% other Christian denominations), 27.7% were Muslim, 11.6% practiced Vodun, 2.6% practiced other local traditional religions, 2.6% practiced other religions, and 5.8% claimed no religious affiliation.According to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Analysis in Benin, those living under the poverty line have increased from 36.2% in 2011 to 40.1% in 2015.The literacy rate in Benin is among the lowest in the world: in 2015 it was estimated to be 38.4% (49.9% for males and 27.3% for females).This has since been updated and complemented by new texts on science and innovation (the year of adoption is between brackets):Equally important are Benin's efforts to integrate science into existing policy documents:In 2015, Benin's priority areas for scientific research were: health, education, construction and building materials, transportation and trade, culture, tourism and handicrafts, cotton/textiles, food, energy and climate change.The main challenges facing research and development in Benin are:In 2007, Benin counted 1,000 researchers (in headcounts).A government survey conducted by the Demographic and Health Surveys Program in 2011-2012 indicated that followers of Christianity had increased to 57.5% of the population (with Catholics making up 33.9%, Methodists 3.0%, Celestials 6.2% and other Christians 14.5%), while Muslims had declined to 22.8%.Benin, a narrow, northxe2x80x93south strip of land in West Africa, lies between latitudes 6xc2xb0 and 13xc2xb0N, and longitudes 0xc2xb0 and 4xc2xb0E. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The prominent roles of West Indians among Bermuda's black politicians and labour activists predated party politics in Bermuda, as exemplified by E. F. Gordon.The decision to join CARICOM stirred up a huge amount of debate and speculation among the Bermudian community and politicians.The UBP, which had been in government from 1968 to 1998, argued that joining CARICOM was detrimental to Bermuda's interests:Once known as "the Gibraltar of the West" and "Fortress Bermuda", Bermuda today is defended by British forces.To guard the dockyard, the British Army built a large Bermuda Garrison, and heavily fortified the archipelago.During the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States, the British attacks on Washington, D.C. and the Chesapeake were planned and launched from Bermuda, where the headquarters of the Royal Navy's North American Station had recently been moved from Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1816, James Arnold, the son of Benedict Arnold, fortified Bermuda's Royal Naval Dockyard against possible US attacks.Other islands such as Morgan's Island held 884 men, including 27 officers; Tucker's Island held 809 Boer prisoners, Burt's Island 607, and Port's Island held 35.The New York Times reported an attempted mutiny by Boer prisoners of war en route to Bermuda and that martial law was enacted on Darrell's Island,The most famous escapee was the Boer prisoner of war Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne, who was serving a life sentence for "conspiracy against the British government and on (the charge of) espionage".Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute, the Botanical Gardens and Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art, lighthouses, and the Crystal Caves with stalactites and underground saltwater pools.It is not possible to rent a car on the island; public transport and taxis are available or visitors can hire scooters for use as private transport.Bermuda consists of more than 150 limestone islands, but 5 main islands, along the southern margin of the Bermuda Platform, which is one of three topographic highs found on the Bermuda Pedestal.The rest became part of the public school system and were either aided or maintained.There are 38 schools in the Bermuda Public School System, including 10 preschools, 18 primary schools, 5 middle schools, 2 senior schools (The Berkeley Institute and Cedarbridge Academy), 1 school for students with physical and cognitive challenges, and 1 for students with behavioural problems.For higher education, the Bermuda College offers various associate degrees and other certificate programmes.In May 2009, the Bermudian Government's application was approved to become a contributory member of the University of the West Indies (UWI).The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service.Banking and other financial services form the largest sector of the economy at circa 85% of GDP, with tourism being the second largest industry at 5%.In 1970 the country switched its currency from the Bermudian pound to the Bermudian dollar, which is pegged at par with the US dollar.The Cenotaph in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual Remembrance Day commemoration.Today, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than naval and army cadet corps, is the Bermuda Regiment, an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The region was administered by the Ottomans as the Sanjak of Herzegovina (Hersek) within the Eyalet of Bosnia up until the formation of the short-lived Herzegovina Eyalet in the 1830s, which remerged in the 1850s, after which the entity became commonly known as Bosnia and Herzegovina.On initial proclamation of independence in 1992, the country's official name was the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina but following the 1995 Dayton Agreement and the new constitution that accompanied it the official name was changed to Bosnia and Herzegovina.Bosnia has been inhabited by humans since at least the Paleolithic, as one of the oldest cave paintings was found in Badanj cave.Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas, by international law, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a right of passage to the outer sea.Sarajevo is the capital Other major cities are Banja Luka and Bihaxc4x87 in the northwest region known as Bosanska Krajina, Bijeljina and Tuzla in the northeast, Zenica in the central part of Bosnia and Mostar, the largest city in Herzegovina.There are seven major rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina:Phytogeographically, Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and is shared between the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region and Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region.By the end of 2017, public debt was xe2x82xac5.92& billion, which amounted to 35.6 percent of GDP.In 2017, the country received xe2x82xac397.35& million in foreign direct investment, which equals to 2.5% of the GDP.In 2018, the total value of mergers and acquisitions in Bosnia and Herzegovina amounted to xe2x82xac404.6& million.In 2018, Bosnia and Herzegovina received 783.4& million KM (xe2x82xac400.64& million) in direct foreign investment, which was equivalent to 2.3% of GDP.In 2018, Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina made a profit of 8,430,875& km (xe2x82xac4,306,347).The World Bank predicts that the economy will grow 3.4% in 2019.Bosnia and Herzegovina was placed 83rd on the Index of Economic Freedom for 2019."Some of the tourist attractions in Bosnia and Herzegovina include:Sarajevo International Airport , also known as Butmir Airport, is the main international airport in Bosnia and Herzegovina, located  southwest of the Sarajevo main railway station in the city of Sarajevo in the suburb of Butmir.Railway operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina are successors of the Yugoslav Railways within the country boundaries following independence from the Former Yugoslavia in 1992.The Bosnian communications market was fully liberalised in January 2006.There are various other institutions of higher education, including: University "Dxc5xbeemal Bijedixc4x87" of Mostar, University of Banja Luka, University of Mostar, University of East Sarajevo, University of Tuzla, American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is held in high regard as one of the most prestigious creative arts academies in the region.Also, Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to several private and international higher education institutions, some of which are:Primary schooling lasts for nine years.The Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina is pursuing the acquisition of new aircraft including helicopters and perhaps even fighter jets.The implementation of the Dayton Accords of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the international community, on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the former Yugoslavia.Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, relations with its neighbors of Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro have been fairly stable since the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995.Nonetheless, Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed.The Austro-Hungarian authorities established an auxiliary militia known as the Schutzkorps with a moot role in the empire's policy of anti-Serb repression.Although the initial split of the country into 33 oblasts erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as Mehmed Spaho ensured the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into banates or banovinas that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.Full membership was expected in 2014 or 2015, depending on the progress of reforms.According to the 1991 census, Bosnia and Herzegovina had a population of 4,369,319, while the 1996 World Bank Group census showed a decrease to 3,764,425.Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to three ethnic "constituent peoples", namely Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats, plus a number of smaller groups including Jews and Roma.According to the 1992 European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the following minority languages: Albanian, Montenegrin, Czech, Italian, Hungarian, Macedonian, German, Polish, Romani, Romanian, Rusyn, Slovak, Slovene, Turkish, Ukrainian and Jewish (Yiddish and Ladino). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Brunei has technically been under martial law since the Brunei Revolt of 1962.Officially, Brunei's foreign policy is as follows:As an Islamic country, Brunei became a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) in January 1984 at the Fourth Islamic Summit held in Morocco.After its accession to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in 1989, Brunei hosted the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in November 2000 and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in July 2002.Brunei shares a close relationship with Singapore and the Philippines.Scholars claim that the power of the Sultanate of Brunei was at its peak between the 15th and 17th centuries, with its power extending from northern Borneo to the southern Philippines (Sulu) and even in the northern Philippines (Manila) which Brunei incorporated via territorial acquisition accomplished through royal marriages. Brunei briefly rose to prominence in Southeast Asia when the Portuguese occupied Malacca and thereby forced the wealthy and powerful but displaced Muslim refugees there to relocate to nearby Sultanates such as Aceh and Brunei.HSBC, which had entered in 1947, closed its operation in Brunei in November 2017.Ethnicities indigenous to Brunei include the Belait, Brunei Bisaya (not to be confused with the Bisaya/Visaya of the nearby Philippines), indigenous Bruneian Malay, Dusun, Kedayan, Lun Bawang, Murut and Tutong.The population of Brunei in  was , of which 76% live in urban areas.The average life expectancy is 77.7 years.There is a relatively large expatriate community.Most expats come from non-Muslim countries such as Australia, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, The Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and India.Islam is the official religion of Brunei,The principal spoken language is Melayu Brunei (Brunei Malay).In 2015, the head of the Catholic Church in Brunei told The Brunei Times, "To be quite honest there has been no change for us this year; no new restrictions have been laid down, although we fully respect and adhere to the existing regulations that our celebrations and worship be [confined] to the compounds of the church and private residences".Brunei's revised penal code came into force in phases, commencing on 22 April 2014 with offences punishable by fines or imprisonment.Brunei is the first country in Asia to have banned shark finning nationwide.Brunei has retained most of its forests, compared to its neighbours that share Borneo island. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> At elections, in addition to voting their local representative, voters also cast votes for four "at-large" candidates who are elected upon a territory-wide basis.The territory is also technically divided into five administrative districts (one for each of the four largest islands, with the fifth covering all other islands), and into six civil registry districts (three for Tortola, Jost Van Dyke, Virgin Gorda and Anegada) although these have little practical relevance.Crime in the British Virgin Islands is comparatively low by Caribbean standards (and indeed compared to the neighbouring US Virgin Islands).The British and US Virgin Islands sit at the axis of a major drugs transshipment point between Latin America and the continental United States.The official currency of the British Virgin Islands has been the United States dollar (US$) since 1959, the currency also used by the United States Virgin Islands.Deemed by some to be a tax haven due to its opaque banking system, The average monthly income earned by a worker in the territory was US$2,452 as at the time of the 2010 Census.Since 2001, financial services in the British Virgin Islands have been regulated by the independent Financial Services Commission.Citco, also known as the Citgo Group of Companies and the Curaxc3xa7ao International Trust Co., is a privately owned global hedge fund administrator headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, founded in 1948.As such the British Virgin Islands is frequently labelled as a "tax haven" by campaigners and NGOs,In the April 2016 Panama Papers leak, the British Virgin Islands was the most commonly used tax haven by clients of Mossack Fonseca.On June 30, 2014, The British Virgin Islands Helicopters are used to get to islands with no runway facilities; Antilles Helicopter Services is the only helicopter service based in the country.The main harbour is in Road Town.Economic linkages with the US islands prompted the British Virgin Islands to adopt the US dollar as its currency in 1959.The British Virgin Islands were administered variously as part of the British Leeward Islands or with St. Kitts and Nevis, with an administrator representing the British Government on the islands.In 2017 Hurricane Irma struck the islands, causing four deaths and immense damage.The British Virgin Islands comprise around 60 tropical Caribbean islands, ranging in size from the largest, Tortola, being  long and  wide, to tiny uninhabited islets, altogether about  in extent. </my-abstract>

According to the Global Hunger Index, a multidimensional tool used to measure and track a country's hunger levels,
The European Commission expects that approximately 500,000& children under age& 5 in Burkina Faso will suffer from acute malnutrition in 2015, including around 149,000 who will suffer from its most life-threatening form.
An October 2018 report by USAid stated that droughts and floods remained problematic, and that "violence and insecurity are disrupting markets, trade and livelihoods activities in some of Burkina Faso's northern and eastern areas". The report estimated that over 954,300 people needed food security support, and that, according to UNICEF, an "estimated 187,200 children under 5 years of age will experience severe acute malnutrition". Agencies providing assistance at the time included USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) working with the UN World Food Programme, the NGO Oxfam Intermón and ACDI/VOCA.
Because the country is landlocked and prone to natural disasters, including drought and floods, many families struggle to protect themselves from severe hunger.

<my-abstract> The Mossi language () is the most spoken language in Burkina Faso, spoken by about half the population, mainly in the central region around the capital, Ouagadougou, along with other, closely related Gurunsi languages scattered throughout Burkina.According to the 2006 Census, the languages spoken natively in Burkina Faso were Mossi by 50.5% of the population, Fula by 9.3%, Gourmanchxc3xa9 by 6.1%, Bambara by 4.9%, Bissa by 3.2%, Bwamu by 2.1%, Dagara by 2%, San by 1.9%, Lobiri with 1.8%, Lyxc3xa9lxc3xa9 with 1.7%, Bobo and Sxc3xa9noufo with 1.4% each, Nuni by 1.2%, Dafing by 1.1%, Tamasheq by 1%, Kassxc3xa9na by 0.7%, Gouin by 0.4%, Dogon, Songhai, and Gourounsi by 0.3% each, Ko, Koussassxc3xa9, Sembla, and Siamou by 0.1% each, other national languages by 5%, other African languages by 0.2%, French (the official language) by 1.3%, and other foreign languages by 0.1%.In the west, Mande languages are widely spoken, the most predominant being Dioula (also known as Jula or Dyula), others including Bobo, Samo, and Marka.In April 2007, popular radio reggae host Karim Sama, whose programs feature reggae songs interspersed with critical commentary on alleged government injustice and corruption, received several death threats.Sama's personal car was later burned outside the private radio station Ouaga FM by unknown vandals.Every two years, Ouagadougou hosts the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO), the largest African cinema festival on the continent (February, odd years).Held every two years since 1988, the International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou (SIAO), is one of Africa's most important trade shows for art and handicrafts (late October-early November, even years).Also every two years, the Symposium de sculpture sur granit de Laongo takes place on a site located about  from Ouagadougou, in the province of Oubritenga.The National Culture Week of Burkina Faso, better known by its French name La Semaine Nationale de la culture (SNC), is one of the most important cultural activities of Burkina Faso.There are some small private colleges in the capital city of Ouagadougou but these are affordable to only a small portion of the population.There is also the International School of Ouagadougou (ISO), an American-based private school located in Ouagadougou.The 2008& UN Development Program Report ranked Burkina Faso as the country with the lowest level of literacy in the world, despite a concerted effort to double its literacy rate from 12.8% in 1990 to 25.3% in 2008.The oral tradition continued to have an influence on Burkinabxc3xa8 writers in the post-independence Burkina Faso of the 1960s, such as Nazi Boni and Roger Nikiema.The theatre of Burkina Faso combines traditional Burkinabxc3xa8 performance with the colonial influences and post-colonial efforts to educate rural people to produce a distinctive national theatre.A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid, despite having gold ores in abundance.The top five export commodities in 2017 were as follows, in order of importance: gems and precious metals, US$1.9& billion (78.5% of total exports), cotton, $198.7& million (8.3%), ores, slag, ash, $137.6& million (5.8%), fruits, nuts: $76.6& million (3.2%) and oil seeds: $59.5& million (2.5%).A December 2018 report from the World Bank indicates that in 2017, economic growth increased to 6.4% in 2017 (vs. 5.9% in 2016) primarily due to gold production and increased investment in infrastructure.Other large predators live in Burkina Faso, such as the cheetah, the caracal or African lynx, the spotted hyena and the African wild dog, one of the continent's most endangered species.Burkina Faso's fauna and flora are protected in four national parks:and several reserves: see List of national parks in Africa and Nature reserves of Burkina Faso.The value of Burkina Faso's exports fell from $2.77& billion in 2011 to $754& million in 2012.Voltaic Mossi make up about 50% of the population and are descended from warriors who moved to the area from Ghana around 1100, establishing an empire that lasted over 800 years".The total fertility rate of Burkina Faso is 5.93& children born per woman (2014 estimates), the sixth highest in the world.In 2009 the U.S. Department of State's Trafficking in Persons Report reported that slavery in Burkina Faso continued to exist and that Burkinabxc3xa8 children were often the victims.}}Burkina Faso is a multilingual country.The Proto-Mossi arrived in the far Eastern part of what is today Burkina Faso sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries, the Dogon lived in Burkina Faso's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuriesStarting in the early 1890s a series of British, French and German military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today Burkina Faso. </my-abstract>

<title>Blindness in literature</title>
<wiki-abstract> Different cultures through history have depicted blindness in a variety of ways; among the Greeks, for example, it was a punishment from the gods, for which the afflicted individual was often granted compensation in the form of artistic genius. Judeo-Christian literature positioned blindness as a flaw; only through a cure could God's love be made manifest, when the scales would fall away from the eyes of an afflicted individual upon contact with a holy man or relic. </wiki-abstract>

The census results are contested by the Republika Srpska statistical office and by Bosnian Serb politicians,
The European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, determined that the methodology used by the Bosnian statistical agency was in line with international recommendations.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, religion is often linked to ethnicity, i.e. (with the exception of agnostics and atheists) most Bosniaks are Muslim, Serbs are Orthodox Christian, and Croats are Roman Catholic.

Bosnia's constitution does not specify any official languages; however, academics Hilary Footitt and Michael Kelly note that the Dayton Agreement states that it is "done in Bosnian, Croatian, English and Serbian", and they describe this as the "de facto recognition of three official languages" at the state level. The equal status of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian was verified by the Constitutional Court in 2000. It ruled that the provisions of the Federation and Republika Srpska constitutions on language were incompatible with the state constitution, since they only recognised "Bosniak" and Croatian (in the case of the Federation) and Serbian (in the case of Republika Srpska) as official languages at the entity level.
As a result, the wording of the entity constitutions was changed and all three languages were made official in both entities.
All standard varieties are based on the Ijekavian varieties of the Shtokavian dialect (non-standard spoken varieties including, beside Ijekavian, also Ikavian Shtokavian). Serbian and Bosnian are written in both Latin and Cyrillic (the latter predominantly using the Latin script), whereas Croatian is written only in Latin alphabet. There are also some speakers of Italian, German, Turkish and Ladino. Yugoslav Sign Language is used with Croatian and Serbian variants.
According to the results of the 2013 census, 52.86% of the population consider their mother tongue to be Bosnian, 30.76% Serbian, 14.6% Croatian and 1.57% another language, with 0.21% not giving an answer.

<my-abstract> b'       { }The Brazilian Armed Forces (, ) is the unified military organization comprising the Brazilian Army (including the Brazilian Army Aviation), the Brazilian Navy (including the Brazilian Marine Corps and Brazilian Naval Aviation) and the Brazilian Air Force.Brazil's armed forces are the second largest in the Americas, after the United States, and the largest in Latin America by the level of military equipment, with 334,500 active-duty troops and officers.The Brazilian military, especially the army, has become more involved in civic-action programs, education, health care, and constructing roads, bridges, and railroads across the nation.Naval operations are directed from the Ministry of Navy in Brasxc3xadlia through the Navy General Staff (Estado-Maior da Armada-EMA), six naval districts (five oceanic and one riverine), and two naval commands-Brasxc3xadlia Naval Command (Comando Naval de Brasxc3xadlia-CNB) and Manaus Naval Command (Comando Naval de Manaus-CNM).The 1st Naval District is located at the country's main naval base in Rio de Janeiro; the 2nd Naval District is in Salvador; the 3rd Naval District is located in Natal; the 4th Naval District is located in Belxc3xa9m; and the 5th Naval District is located in Porto Alegre.Thus, the new charter changed the manner in which the military could exercise its moderating power.The Armed Forces of Brazil are divided into 3 branches:The Military Police (state police) alongside the Military Firefighters Corps are described as an auxiliary and reserve force of the Army.The Brazilian Navy which is the oldest of the Brazilian Armed Forces, includes the Brazilian Marine Corps and the Brazilian Naval Aviation.19xe2x80x9345 years of age for compulsory military service; conscript service obligation xe2x80x93 10 to 12 months; 17xe2x80x9345 years of age for voluntary service.The Ministries of Defense of Germany, Argentina, Chile, Spain, USA, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Portugal had been chosen for deepened analysis because they had some type of identification with Brazil, as territorial extension, population, budget and finance of the Armed Forces, amongst others.On 10 July 1999, the Ministry of Defence was created, with the abolition of the EMFA and the merger of all three ministries of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air Force) into a singular ministry of the Cabinet.To give continuity to the creation studies, President Fernando Henrique created the Inter-ministerial Work group that defined the lines of direction for implantation of the Ministry of Defense. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The BRICS states have been amongst the most powerful drivers of incremental change in world diplomacy and they benefit most from the connected global power shifts.The Brazilian foreign policy under the Lula da Silva administration focused on the following directives: to contribute toward the search for greater equilibrium and attenuate unilateralism; to strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations in order to increase the country's weight in political and economic negotiations on an international level; to deepen relations so as to benefit from greater economical, financial, technological and cultural interchange; to avoid agreements that could jeopardize development in the long term.These directives implied precise emphasis on: the search for political coordination with emerging and developing countries, namely India, South Africa, Russia and China; creation of the Union of South American Nations and its derivative bodies, such as the South American Security Council; strengthening of Mercosul; projection at the Doha Round and WTO; maintenance of relations with developed countries, including the United States; undertaking and narrowing of relations with African countries; campaign for the reform of the United Nations Security Council and for a permanent seat for Brazil; and defense of social objectives allowing for a greater equilibrium between the States and populations.The foreign policy of the Rousseff administration sought to deepen Brazil's regional commercial dominance and diplomacy, expand Brazil's presence in Africa, and play a major role in the G20 on global warming and in other multilateral settings.Brazilian foreign policy has recently aimed to strengthen ties with other South American countries, engage in multilateral diplomacy through the United Nations and the Organization of American States, and act at times as a countervailing force to U.S. political and economic influence in Latin America.Brazil's international relations are based on article 4 of the Federal Constitution, which establishes non-intervention, self-determination, international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also known as Itamaraty, is the government department responsible for advising the President and conducting Brazil's foreign relations with other countries and international bodies. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Mesozoic era (252& million to 66& million years ago) saw the beginning of the Alpine orogeny that has formed the mountain ranges of the Alpide belt, including the Balkan Mountains and Sredna Gora.Examples of rock formations in Bulgaria:File:xd0x91xd0xb5xd0xbbxd0xbexd0xb3xd1x80xd0xb0xd0xb4xd1x87xd0xb8xd1x88xd0xbaxd0xb8 xd1x81xd0xbaxd0xb0xd0xbbxd0xb8 07.JPG|Belogradchik Rocks, western Balkan MountainsFile:Devetashka pestera lqto 2009 1.JPG|Devetashka cave, Pre-BalkanFile:Bulgarian Pyramid.jpg|Melnik Earth Pyramids, Pirin MountainsFile:Bulgaria-Pobiti Kamani-04.jpg|Pobiti Kamani, Danubian PlainFile:xd0xa1xd0xbbxd1x8axd0xbdxd1x87xd0xb5xd0xb2xd0xb8 xd0xbbxd1x8axd1x87xd0xb8.JPG|Marvelous Bridges, Rhodope MountainsExogenous processes such as weathering, erosion and sedimentation have an important impact on modelling the land surface and creating rock formations.The Danubian Plain encompasses the Moesian plate and extends from the river Timok in the west to the Black Sea in the east and from the river Danube in the north to the Balkan Mountains in the south, covering 31,520& km<sup>2</sup>, or almost 1/3 of Bulgaria's total area.The predominant soil types are loess in the north, reaching a depth of up to 100& m at the banks of the Danube, and chernozem in the south.The easternmost sections near the Black Sea are hilly, but they gradually gain height to the west until the westernmost part of the country is entirely high ground.Table, showing the distribution of the height zones in Bulgaria:More than two-thirds of the country is plains, plateaus, or hilly land at an altitude less than 600& m. Plains (below 200& m) make up 31% of the land, plateaus and hills (200 to 600& m) 41%, low mountains (600 to 1,000& m) 10%, medium-high mountains (1,000 to 1,500& m) 10%, and high mountains (over 1,500& m) 3%.The geographic center of Bulgaria is located in Uzana.Bulgaria features notable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped peaks in Rila, Pirin and the Balkan Mountains to the mild and sunny Black Sea coast; from the typically continental Danubian Plain (ancient Moesia) in the north to the strong Mediterranean climatic influence in the valleys of Macedonia and in the lowlands in the southernmost of Thrace, the lowest parts of the Upper Thracian Plain, along the Maritsa River, the Southern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.After 1989, after forty-five years of single party system, Bulgaria had an unstable party system, dominated by democratic parties and opposition to socialists - the Union of Democratic Forces and several personalistic parties and the post-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party or its creatures, which emerged for a short period of time in the past decade, personalistic parties could be seen as the governing Simeon II's NDSV party and Boyko Borisov's GERB party.Bulgaria has generally good freedom of speech and human rights records as reported by the US Library of Congress Federal Research Division in 2006,xe2x80x93 [http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&year=2008&country=7361 Bulgaria country report for 2008], freedomhouse.orgAfter the fall of the communism in 1989, the former communist party was restructured and succeeded by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), which won the first post-communist elections for the Constitutional Assembly in 1990 with a small majority. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In 2005, economists observed a slowdown to about 1.8 billion euro ($2.3 billion) in the FDI, which is attributed mainly to the end of the privatization of the major state owned companies.After joining the European Union in 2007, Bulgaria registered a peak in foreign investment of about 6 bln euro.Low productivity and competitiveness on the European and world markets alike due to inadequate R&D funding, however, still remain a significant obstacle for foreign investment.Nevertheless, according to the latest Annual report of the Economic Research Institute at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the average salary in Bulgaria is a quarter (1/4) of the average salary in the European Union, and should be two times higher when the labour productivity is calculated in the formula.During the Great Recession, Bulgaria saw its economy decline by 5.5% in 2009, but quickly restored positive growth levels to 0.2% in 2010, in contrast to other Balkan countries.The 2012 Transatlantic Trends poll found that 72 percent of Bulgarians did not approve of the economic policy pursued by the government of the (then) ruling center-right GERB party and Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.20.5 %Actual Current and Past DataHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:Distribution of family income - Gini index:36.6% (2013)Industrial production growth rate:11.3% (Third Quarter)Electricity:Electricity - production by source:Oil:Natural gas:Agriculture - products:vegetables, fruits, tobacco, livestock, wine, wheat, barley, sunflowers, sugar beetsCurrent account balance:$ -5.01 billion (2006 est.Primary industrial exports are clothing, iron and steel, machinery and refined fuels.Sofia is the capital and economic heart of Bulgaria and home to most major Bulgarian and international companies operating in the country, as well as the Bulgarian National Bank and the Bulgarian Stock Exchange.Plovdiv is the second-largest city and has one of the largest economies in Bulgaria.Varna is the third largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.Bulgaria produced 38.07& billion kWh of electricity in 2006Photius.com, [http://www.photius.com/rankings/economy/electricity_production_2006_0.html Electricity production as of 2006](in comparison, Romania, which has a population nearly three times larger than Bulgaria, produced 51.7 billion kWxc2xb7h Most of Bulgaria's conventional power stations will require large-scale modernization in the near future.Still, the Bulgarian economy made significant overall progress in modernizing road infrastructure, airline transportation, as well as developing the tourism sector by building tourist resorts along the Black sea coast and the mountain regions.From the end of World War II until the widespread change of regime in Eastern Europe in November 1989, the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) exerted complete economic, social and political control in Bulgaria. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Modern EU-made transport helicopters were purchased in 2005 and a total of 12 Eurocopter Cougar have been delivered (eight transport and four CSAR).Three Eurocopter AS565 Panther for the Bulgarian Navy in 2016.Branches of the Air Force include: fighter aviation, assault aviation, intelligence aviation and transportation aviation, aid defence troops, radio-technical troops, communications troops, radio-technical support troops, logistics and medical troops.The Bulgarian Ministry of Defense has announced plans to withdraw and replace the MiG-29 fighters with new F-16V Fighting Falcon by 2025xe2x80x932026.With the exception of the Navy's small helicopter fleet, the Air Forces are responsible for all military aircraft in Bulgaria.On 8 September 1944 the Bulgarian army joined the Soviet Union in its war against Germany.As the Red Army invaded Bulgaria in 1944 and installed a communist government, the armed forces were rapidly forced to reorganise following the Soviet model, and were renamed the Bulgarian People's Army (Bulgarska Narodna Armiya, BNA).Only several years after its inception in 1878, Bulgaria became a regional military power and was involved in several major wars xe2x80x93 Serbo-Bulgarian War (1885), First Balkan War (1912xe2x80x9313), Second Balkan War (1913), First World War (1915xe2x80x931918) and Second World War (1941xe2x80x931945), during which the Army gained significant combat experience.After a month and two days of fighting, the war ended as a moral disaster for Bulgaria, and at the same time its economy was ruined and its military demoralized.The Kingdom of Bulgaria participated in World War I on the side of the Central Powers between 15 October 1915, when the country declared war on Serbia, and 29 September 1918, when the Armistice of Thessalonica was signed. </my-abstract>

peninsula of Istanbul to Anadolu Kavaxc4x9fxc4xb1 near the Black Sea, zigzagging and calling briefly multiple times at the Rumelian and Anatolian sides of the city.One recent hypothesis, dubbed the Black Sea deluge hypothesis, which was launched by a study of the same name in 1997 by two scientists from Columbia University, postulates that the Bosporus was flooded around 5600 BC (revised to 6800 BC in 2003) when the rising waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Marmara breached through to the Black Sea, which at the time, according to the hypothesis, was a low-lying body of fresh water.Many geologists, however, claim that the strait is much older, even if relatively young on a geologic timescale.From the perspective of ancient Greek mythology, it was said that colossal floating rocks known as the Symplegades, or Clashing Rocks, once occupied the hilltops on both sides of the Bosporus, and destroyed any ship that attempted passage of the channel by rolling down the strait's hills and violently crushing all vessels between them.Today, the Bosphorus Command is located on the shores of the Bosphorus and the military ships connected to the Command are anchoring in the Bosphorus waters.Located on a peninsula at the intersection of the Black Sea, the Bosphorus and the Marmara Sea, Istanbul has been one of the most protected and hardest cities for centuries.The Bosphorus has 620 waterfront houses (yalxc4xb1) built during the Ottoman period along the strait's European and Asian shorelines. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It was estimated that, in 2005, people of Muslim background living in the Brussels Region numbered 256,220 and accounted for 25.5% of the city's population, a much higher concentration than those of the other regions of Belgium.The architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the clashing combination of Gothic, Baroque, and Louis XIV styles on the Grand Place to the postmodern buildings of the EU institutions.Located outside the centre, in a greener environment, are the Parc du Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark with its triumphal arch and nearby museums, and in Laeken, the Royal Castle of Laeken and the Royal Domain with its large greenhouses, as well as the Museums of the Far East.Also particularly striking are the buildings in the Art Nouveau style, most famously by the Belgian architects Victor Horta, Paul Hankar and Henry Van de Velde.File:BE Bruxelles Horta Tassel.JPG|Hxc3xb4tel Tassel by Victor Horta (1893)File:Tassel House stairway-00.JPG|Stairway in Hxc3xb4tel TasselFile:Hxc3xb4tel Ciamberlani 2007.JPG|Hxc3xb4tel Ciamberlani by Paul Hankar (1897)File:Old England facade, Brussels (DSCF7544).jpg|Old England department store by Paul Saintenoy (1899)File:Bruxelles - Strauven 050917 (1).JPG|Saint Cyr House by Gustave Strauven (1903)File:Maison Cauchie, Rues des Francs - Franken-straat 5, pic1.JPG|Cauchie House by Paul Cauchie (1905)File:Maison Cauchie sgraffitopaneel.jpg|Sgraffito panel in the Cauchie HouseFile:20120923 Brussels PalaisStoclet Hoffmann DSC06725 PtrQs.jpg|Stoclet Palace by Josef Hoffmann (1911)Art Deco structures in Brussels include the Residence Palace (1927) (now part of the Europa building), the Centre for Fine Arts (1928), the Villa Empain (1934), the Town Hall of Forest (1938), and the Flagey Building on Flagey Square (1935xe2x80x931938) in Ixelles., it has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the only Belgian component to the multinational inscription 'Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe'.File:Brussels Park in summer 2007 1.JPG|Brussels' ParkFile:Brussels, Jardin du Mont des Arts foto5 2015-06-07 14.01.jpg|Mont des Arts / KunstbergFile:Brussels Cinquantenaire R04.jpg|Parc du Cinquantenaire / JubelparkFile:Brusel, Bois de la Cambre, jezero.jpg|Bois de la Cambre / Ter KamerenbosFile:Botanical Garden of Brussels during golden hour (DSCF8171).jpg|The Botanical Garden of BrusselsFile:Ixelles Ponds.JPG|Ixelles PondsFile:Parc de Forest - 20080325.JPG|Forest ParkFile:Royal Greenhouses in Laeken (5704647112).jpg|The Royal Greenhouses of LaekenFile:Autumn light in the Sonian Forest.jpg|Sonian ForestBrussels is twinned with the following cities:}} 'Other important institutions in the City of Brussels are the Constitutional Court, the Council of State, the Court of Audit, the Royal Belgian Mint and the National Bank of Belgium.The City of Brussels is also the capital of both the French Community of Belgium and so do the Parliament of the French Community and the Government of the French Community.The 19 municipalities (French: , Dutch: ) of the Brussels-Capital Region are political subdivisions with individual responsibilities for the handling of local level duties, such as law enforcement and the upkeep of schools and roads within its borders.In addition, the University of Kent's Brussels School of International Studies is a specialised postgraduate school offering advanced international studies.Also a dozen of university colleges are located in Brussels, including two drama schools, founded in 1832: the French-speaking Conservatoire Royal and its Dutch-speaking equivalent, the Koninklijk Conservatorium.Most of Brussels pupils between the ages of 3 and 18 go to schools organised by the French-speaking Community or the Flemish Community, with close to 80% going to French-speaking schools, and roughly 20% to Dutch-speaking schools.The main reason for this was a political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time; this made French the only language of administration, law, politics and education in Belgium, and thus necessary for social mobility.Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian language border, and after the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use.Given its Dutch-speaking origins and the role that the City of Brussels plays as capital in a bilingual country, the administration of the entire Brussels-Capital Region is fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services.The regional parliament can enact ordinances (French: , Dutch: ), which have equal status as a national legislative act.19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium, and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the Flemish Parliament.Except for the Royal Military Academy, a military college established in 1834, all universities in Brussels are private/autonomous.The Universitxc3xa9 libre de Bruxelles, a French-speaking university, with about 20,000 students, has three campuses in the city,Saint-Louis University, Brussels (also known as UCLouvain Saint-Louis xe2x80x93 Bruxelles) was founded in 1858 and is specialised in social and human sciences, with 4,000 students, and located on two campuses in the City of Brussels and Ixelles.]]The French Community and the Flemish Community exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the French Community Commission (French:  or COCOF) and the Flemish Community Commission (Dutch:  or VGC). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article.The shape and size of the brain varies greatly between species, and identifying common features is often difficult.The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells: neurons and glial cells.The electrical properties of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes, most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses.Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released at synapses when the local membrane is depolarised and Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters into the cell, typically when an action potential arrives at the synapse xe2x80x93 neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse's target cell (or cells), and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules.With few exceptions, each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle.There are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function.In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely to guide development.In humans and many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain.There has long been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and intelligence can be attributed to heredity or to upbringingxe2x80x94this is the nature and nurture controversy.The functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells, and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells.The computational functions of the brain are studied both by computer scientists and neuroscientists.Computational neurogenetic modeling is concerned with the study and development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes.Recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to the study of the brain The oldest brain to have been discovered was in Armenia in the Areni-1 cave complex. </my-abstract>

The fall of the communist government in neighboring Poland's 1989 Polish legislative election in June played a role in the fall of the Berlin Wall. Also in June 1989 the Hungarian government began dismantling the electrified fence along its border with Austria (with Western TV crews present), and then, in September, more than 13,000 East German tourists escaped through Hungary to Austria.
The longtime leader of East Germany, Erich Honecker, resigned on 18 October 1989 and was replaced by Egon Krenz that day.
The wave of refugees leaving East Germany for the West kept increasing. By early November refugees were finding their way to Hungary via Czechoslovakia, or via the West German Embassy in Prague. This was tolerated by the new Krenz government, because of long-standing agreements with the communist Czechoslovak government, allowing free travel across their common border. However this movement of people grew so large it caused difficulties for both countries. To ease the difficulties, the politburo led by Krenz decided on 9 November to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between East Germany and West Germany, including between East and West Berlin. Later the same day, the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private, round-trip, and travel. The new regulations were to take effect the next day.
Günter Schabowski, the party boss in East Berlin and the spokesman for the SED Politburo, had the task of announcing the new regulations. However, he had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated. 
Excerpts from Schabowski's press conference were the lead story on West Germany's two main news programs that night—at 7:17& p.m. on ZDF's heute and at 8 p.m. on ARD's Tagesschau. As ARD and ZDF had broadcast to nearly all of East Germany since the late 1950s and had become accepted by the East German authorities, the news was broadcast there as well simultaneously. Later that night, on ARD's Tagesthemen, anchorman Hanns Joachim Friedrichs proclaimed, "This 9 November is a historic day. The GDR has announced that, starting immediately, its borders are open to everyone. The gates in the Wall stand open wide."
After hearing the broadcast, East Germans began gathering at the Wall, at the six checkpoints between East and West Berlin, demanding that border guards immediately open the gates.
Another border crossing to the south may have been opened earlier. An account by Heinz Schäfer indicates that he also acted independently and ordered the opening of the gate at Waltersdorf-Rudow a couple of hours earlier. This may explain reports of East Berliners appearing in West Berlin earlier than the opening of the Bornholmer Straße border crossing.
Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, The Guardian collected short stories from 9 November 1989 by five German writers who reflect on the day. In this, Kathrin Schmidt remembers comically: 'I downed almost an entire bottle of schnapps'. piece of the first (westernmost) wall at the Topography of Terror, site of the former Gestapo headquarters, halfway between Checkpoint Charlie and Potsdamer Platz; a longer section of the second (easternmost) wall along the Spree River near the Oberbaumbrücke, nicknamed East Side Gallery; and a third section that is partly reconstructed, in the north at Bernauer Straße, which was turned into a memorial in 1999. Other isolated fragments, lampposts, other elements, and a few watchtowers also remain in various parts of the city.
Nothing still accurately represents the Wall's original appearance better than a very short stretch at Bernauer Straße associated with the Berlin Wall Documentation Center.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, there were initiatives that they want to preserve the death strip walkways and redevelop it into a hiking and cycling area, known as Berliner Mauerweg. It is part of the initiative by Berlin Senate since 2005.
 , 
For many years after reunification, people in Germany talked about cultural differences between East and West Germans (colloquially Ossis and Wessis), sometimes described as Mauer im Kopf (The wall in the head). A September 2004 poll found that 25 percent of West Germans and 12 percent of East Germans wished that East and West should be separated again by a "Wall".
A 2009 poll conducted by Russia's VTsIOM, found that more than half of all Russians do not know who built the Berlin Wall. Ten percent of people surveyed thought Berlin residents built it themselves. Six percent said Western powers built it and four percent thought it was a "bilateral initiative" of the Soviet Union and the West. Fifty-eight percent said they did not know who built it, with just 24 percent correctly naming the Soviet Union and its then-communist ally East Germany.
 , 
On 13 August 2011, Germany marked the 50th anniversary of East Germany beginning the erection of the Berlin Wall. Chancellor Angela Merkel joined with President Christian Wulff and Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit at the Bernauer Straße memorial park to remember lives and liberty. Speeches extolled freedom and a minute of silence at noon honored those who died trying to flee to the West. "It is our shared responsibility to keep the memory alive and to pass it on to the coming generations as a reminder to stand up for freedom and democracy to ensure that such injustice may never happen again," entreated Mayor Wowereit. "It has been shown once again: Freedom is invincible at the end. No wall can permanently withstand the desire for freedom", proclaimed President Wulff.

<my-abstract> After the 1972 agreements, new crossings were opened to allow West Berlin waste to be transported into East German dumps, as well as some crossings for access to West Berlin's exclaves (see Steinstxc3xbccken).Four autobahns connected West Berlin to West Germany, including Berlin-Helmstedt autobahn, which entered East German territory between the towns of Helmstedt and Marienborn (Checkpoint Alpha), and which entered West Berlin at Dreilinden (Checkpoint Bravo for the Allied forces) in southwestern Berlin.This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually (Begrxc3xbcxc3x9fungsgeld, or welcome money) to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.Citizens of other East European countries were in general subject to the same prohibition of visiting Western countries as East Germans, though the applicable exception (if any) varied from country to country.Allied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces could enter and exit East Berlin without submitting to East German passport controls, purchasing a visa or being required to exchange money.The direct cost of manpower losses to East Germany (and corresponding gain to the West) has been estimated at $7& billion to $9& billion, with East German party leader Walter Ulbricht later claiming that West Germany owed him $17& billion in compensation, including reparations as well as manpower losses.The exodus of emigrants from East Germany presented two minor potential benefits: an easy opportunity to smuggle East German secret agents to West Germany, and a reduction in the number of citizens hostile to the communist regime.These could be used for transit between West Germany and West Berlin, for visits by West Berliners into East Germany, for transit into countries neighbouring East Germany (Poland, Czechoslovakia, Denmark), and for visits by East Germans into West Berlin carrying a permit. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The bass player emphasizes the root or fifth of the chord in their basslines (and to a lesser degree, the third of the chord) and accents the strong beats.In classical music, different forms of bass are: basso concertante, or basso recitante; the bass voice of the chorus; the bass which accompanies the softer passages of a composition, as well as those passages which employ the whole power of the ensemble, generally played by the violoncellos in orchestral music; contrabass (xe2x80x9cunder bassxe2x80x9d), is described as that part which is performed by the double basses; violoncellos often play the same line an octave higher, or a different melodic or rhythmic part which is not a bassline when double basses are used; basso ripieno; that bass which joins in the full passages of a composition, and, by its depth of tone and energy of stroke, affords a powerful contrast to the lighter and softer passages or movements.Basso continuo was an approach to writing music during the Baroque music era (1600-1750). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It indicated the development of a self-conscious and distinctively rebellious British Asian youth culture centred on an experiential sense of self, e.g., language, gesture, bodily signification, desires, etc., in a situation in which tensions with British culture and racist elements in British society had resulted in alienation in many minority ethnic groups, fostered a sense of need for an affirmation of a positive identity and culture, and provided a platform for British Punjabi males to assert their masculinity.In the 1980s, distributed by record labels such as Multitone Records, bhangra artists were selling over 30,000 cassettes a week in the UK, but no artists reached the Top 40 UK chart despite these artists outselling popular British ones; most of the bhangra cassette sales were not through the large UK record stores, whose sales were those recorded by the Official UK Charts Company for creating their rankings.The group Alaap (band) formed in 1977, co-founded by Channi Singh and Harjeet Gandhi who both hailed from Southall, a Punjabi area in London.Using folk instruments and hip-hop samples, along with relatively inexpensive folk vocals imported from Punjab, Punjabi folk music was able to cause the decline of bhangra music.Pioneering DJs instrumental in the decline of bhangra were Mick St Clair, Bally Sagoo and Panjabi MC. </my-abstract>

confirmed it would be strictly instrumental and erroneously reported a release date scheduled for July 10, 2007.The band played several tracks from the album at the 2007 Virgin Festival at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland.They headlined the Langerado Music Festival in South Florida on Friday, March 7, 2008They won a Grammy for The Mix-Up in the "Best Pop Instrumental Album" category at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards in 2008.In February 2009, Yauch revealed their forthcoming new album had taken the band's sound in a "bizarre" new direction, saying "It's a combination of playing and sampling stuff as we're playing, and also sampling pretty obscure records."Diamond and Horovitz accepted and read a speech that Yauch had written.On May 4, 2012, Yauch died from cancer at the age of 47.Founding Beastie Boys guitarist John Berry died on May 19, 2016, aged 52, as a result of frontotemporal dementia, The first Beastie Boys show took place at Berry's loft.Yauch's will forbids the use

and Busta Rhymes, but the tour was canceled when drummer Mike D suffered a serious injury due to a bicycle accident.In October 2001, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Beastie Boys organized and headlined the New Yorkers Against Violence Concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom.Their single, "Ch-Check It Out", debuted on The O.C.This was the first and, as of 2008, only time that a band had won awards in both rap and alternative categories.Also at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards they won the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for their contribution to music videos.On September 28, 1999, Beastie Boys joined Elvis Costello to play "Radio Radio" on the 25th anniversary season of Saturday Night Live.Beastie Boys released The Sounds of Science, a two-CD anthology of their works in 1999.b'

<my-abstract> The synthetic verbs also have periphrastic forms, for use in perfects and in simple tenses in which they are deponent.Within a verb phrase, the periphrastic verb comes first, followed by the auxiliary.A Basque noun-phrase is inflected in 17 different ways for case, multiplied by four ways for its definiteness and number (indefinite, definite singular, definite plural, and definite close plural: euskaldun [Basque speaker], euskalduna [the Basque speaker, a Basque speaker], euskaldunak [Basque speakers, the Basque speakers], and euskaldunok [we Basque speakers, those Basque speakers]).The Basque language became the main everyday language,  while other languages like Spanish, Gascon, French, or Latin were preferred for the administration and high education.By the 16th century, the Basque-speaking area was reduced basically to the present-day seven provinces of the Basque Country, excluding the southern part of Navarre, the southwestern part of xc3x81lava, and the western part of Biscay, and including some parts of Bxc3xa9arn.In 1807, Basque was still spoken in the northern half of xc3x81lavaxe2x80x94including its capital city Vitoria-Gasteizxe2x80x94and a vast area in central Navarre, but in these two provinces, Basque experienced a rapid decline that pushed its border northwards.This is especially true in the case of Biscayan and Souletin, which are regarded as the most divergent Basque dialects.Modern Basque dialectology distinguishes five dialects:These dialects are divided in 11 subdialects, and 24 minor varieties among them.According to Koldo Zuazo,Although the influence of the neighbouring Romance languages on the Basque language (especially the lexicon, but also to some degree Basque phonology and grammar) has been much more extensive, it is usually assumed that there has been some feedback from Basque into these languages as well.Basque has adopted about 40 percent of its vocabulary from the Romance languages, and Basque speakers have in turn lent their own words to Romance speakers.The Basque alphabet uses the Latin script.In Basque, the name of the language is officially  (alongside various dialect forms).In French, the language is normally called , though  has become common in recent times.basxc3xb3xc3xa0 ("the forest", absolutive case) vs. bxc3xa1soxc3xa0 ("the glass", absolutive case; an adoption from Spanish vaso); basxc3xb3xc3xa0k ("the forest", ergative case) vs. bxc3xa1soxc3xa0k ("the glass", ergative case) vs. bxc3xa1soak ("the forests" or "the glasses", absolutive case).Given its great deal of variation among dialects, stress is not marked in the standard orthography and Euskaltzaindia (the Academy of the Basque Language) provides only general recommendations for a standard placement of stress, basically to place a high-pitched weak stress (weaker than that of Spanish, let alone that of English) on the second syllable of a syntagma, and a low-pitched even-weaker stress on its last syllable, except in plural forms where stress is moved to the first syllable.This scheme provides Basque with a distinct musicality that differentiates its sound from the prosodical patterns of Spanish (which tends to stress the second-to-last syllable).This system is no longer in general use but is occasionally employed for decorative purposes.{|File:WIKITONGUES- Jon speaking Basque.webm|A Basque speaker, recorded by Wikitongues.File:WIKITONGUES- Txeli speaking Basque.webm|A Basque speaker, recorded in Basque Country, Spain for Wikitongues.File:WIKITONGUES- Ixc3xb1aki speaking Basque.webm|A Basque speaker, recorded during Wikimania 2019 for Wikitongues.

<my-abstract> Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the master's transmission begins in even slots and the slave's in odd slots.The above excludes Bluetooth Low Energy, introduced in the 4.0 specification, which uses the same spectrum but somewhat differently.A master BR/EDR Bluetooth device can communicate with a maximum of seven devices in a piconet (an ad hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology), though not all devices reach this maximum.Most Bluetooth applications are for indoor conditions, where attenuation of walls and signal fading due to signal reflections make the range far lower than specified line-of-sight ranges of the Bluetooth products.Most Bluetooth applications are battery-powered Class& 2 devices, with little difference in range whether the other end of the link is a Class& 1 or Class& 2 device as the lower-powered device tends to set the range limit.represents a significant progression.Cost-reduced single-mode chips, which enable highly integrated and compact devices, feature a lightweight Link Layer providing ultra-low power idle mode operation, simple device discovery, and reliable point-to-multipoint data transfer with advanced power-save and secure encrypted connections at the lowest possible cost.General improvements in version 4.0 include the changes necessary to facilitate BLE modes, as well the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) and Security Manager (SM) services with AES Encryption.Core Specification Addendum 2 was unveiled in December 2011; it contains improvements to the audio Host Controller Interface and to the High Speed (802.11) Protocol Adaptation Layer.Core Specification Addendum 3 revision 2 has an adoption date of 24 July 2012.Core Specification Addendum 4 has an adoption date of 12 February 2013.The Bluetooth SIG announced formal adoption of the Bluetooth v4.1 specification on 4 December 2013.At least one commercial device states "Bluetooth v2.0 without EDR" on its data sheet.Version 2.1 allows various other improvements, including extended inquiry response (EIR), which provides more information during the inquiry procedure to allow better filtering of devices before connection; and sniff subrating, which reduces the power consumption in low-power mode.Version 3.0 + HS of the Bluetooth Core Specification was adopted by the Bluetooth SIG on 21 April 2009.Police are advising users to ensure that any mobile networking connections are de-activated if laptops and other devices are left in this way.In April 2006, researchers from Secure Network and F-Secure published a report that warns of the large number of devices left in a visible state, and issued statistics on the spread of various Bluetooth services and the ease of spread of an eventual Bluetooth worm.In April 2017, security researchers at Armis discovered multiple exploits in the Bluetooth software in various platforms, including Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple iOS, and Google Android.Bluetooth high speed is based on Wi-Fi, and Classic Bluetooth consists of legacy Bluetooth protocols.Bluetooth Low Energy, previously known as Wibree, The provisional names Wibree and Bluetooth ULP (Ultra Low Power) were abandoned and the BLE name was used for a while.Bluetooth wireless headset).High-level protocols such as the SDP (Protocol used to find other Bluetooth devices within the communication range, also responsible for detecting the function of devices in range), RFCOMM (Protocol used to emulate serial port connections) and TCS (Telephony control protocol) interact with the baseband controller through the L2CAP Protocol (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol).It was once popular, but has not been updated since 2005.FreeBSD has included Bluetooth since its v5.0 release, implemented through netgraph.NetBSD has included Bluetooth since its v4.0 release.DragonFly BSD has had NetBSD's Bluetooth implementation since 1.11 (2008).The specifications were formalized by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) and formally announced on 20 May 1998. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> They are also one of six artists to sell a million copies with two singles in the same year.Compared to other best-selling artists of the 1970s like ABBA, Donna Summer, and the Bee Gees, the Boney M. discography is quite unusual xe2x80x93 while the greater part of the band's back catalogue has been remixed, remade, remodeled and reissued all through the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s by producer Frank Farian and record company BMG-Ariola (now Sony Music), most of the original 7" and 12" versions issued on vinyl in the 1970s and early 1980s remained unavailable on CD until 2008 and the release of the box set The Collection and the single CD compilation Rivers of Babylon (A Best of Collection).Boney M. was hugely popular in the Soviet Union in the 1970s, although the song "Rasputin" was banned by the Soviet authorities during the group's concert in Moscow in December 1978.During the 2002 presidential election campaign of South Korea, then-candidate Roh Moo-hyun, who eventually won the presidency at that event, took Bahama Mama to promote his aim of positive political reform.The 2005 Chinese film Shanghai Dreams features a scene depicting a rural Chinese disco in 1983, with teenagers dancing to "Rivers of Babylon" and "Gotta Go Home".In the 2008 Kazakh film Tulpan, the tractor driver Boni continually plays a cassette of Rivers of Babylon, an example of his fascination for all things Western.In the 2008 Chinese film Cheung Gong 7 hou (English title: CJ7), "Sunny" is a vital part of the soundtrack.It is the theme song of the 2011 Taiwanese drama starring Rainie Yang and Wu Chun, xe9x99xbdxe5x85x89xe5xa4xa9xe4xbdxbfxe7x89x87xe9xa0xad, translated as Sunny Girl or Sunshine Angel. 'Special additions to this release were a Mousse T. remix of "Sunny" and a brand new song from 2006, featuring Liz Mitchell, entitled "A Moment of Love".On 10 April 2007, Boney M.'s first four albums were reissued on compact disc with bonus tracks, this time also in the United States (the first time these were available to the U.S. music market since their original releases in the 1970s).In September 2007, Boney M.'s last four original albums, Boonoonoonoos, Ten Thousand Lightyears, Kalimba de Luna - 16 Happy Songs and Eye Dance were reissued on compact disc in Europe and the United States, all including bonus tracks.A second remix album Greatest Hits of All Times &ndash; Remix '89 &ndash; Volume II was released but fared poorly.1992 saw a renewed interest in Boney M.'s music with the "Boney M. Megamix" single returning the group to the UK Top 10 for the first time since 1980, and a subsequent Greatest Hits album reaching the UK Top 20 in 1993. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.Since 2005, Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems.He is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates co-founded Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975, in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it went on to become the world's largest personal computer software company.Since 1987, he has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors.In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5& billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6& billion.Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In 1978, Belgian Blue cattle were introduced to the United States by Nick Tutt, a farmer from central Canada who immigrated to West Texas and showed the cattle to universities in the region.The Belgian Blue has a natural mutation in the myostatin gene which codes for the protein, myostatin ("myo" meaning muscle and "statin" meaning stop).Belgian Blue cattle have improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) due to lower feed intake compared to weight gainThe value of the double-muscling breed is due to their superior carcass characteristics. </my-abstract>

<title>Boron</title>
<wiki-abstract> Boron is a chemical element with the symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar System and in the Earth's crust. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> It has a half-life of 3.5xc3x9710<sup>xe2x88x9222</sup> s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH) and therefore may be responsible for the large <sup>11</sup>B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust; this difference may act as an isotopic signature.The exotic <sup>17</sup>B exhibits a nuclear halo, i.e.The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure <sup>11</sup>B.Because of its high neutron cross-section, boron-10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron-capturing substance.In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, <sup>10</sup>B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield.The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.Elemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth.Boron is added to the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers.Boron fibers (boron filaments) are high-strength, lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures as a component of composite materials, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods.Boron fibers and sub-millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition.However, multiple boron atoms reacting with each other have a tendency to form novel dodecahedral (12-sided) and icosahedral (20-sided) structures composed completely of boron atoms, or with varying numbers of carbon heteroatoms.Organoboron chemicals have been employed in uses as diverse as boron carbide (see below), a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron-carbon cluster anions and cations, to carboranes, carbon-boron cluster chemistry compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including carborane acid, a superacid. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, reduction of bromine with red phosphorus is a more practical way to produce hydrogen bromide in the laboratory:At room temperature, hydrogen bromide is a colourless gas, like all the hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen bromide at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised.Unlike hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous liquid hydrogen bromide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its dielectric constant is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into HBr<sup>+</sup> and  ions xe2x80x93 the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the bifluoride ions () due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and bromine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as Cs<sup>+</sup> and quaternary ammonium cation| (R = Me, Et, Bu<sup>n</sup>) may still be isolated.Silver bromide is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for bromine.The halogens form many binary, diamagnetic interhalogen compounds with stoichiometries XY, XY).The pale-brown bromine monofluoride (BrF) is unstable at room temperature, disproportionating quickly and irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride.These methods work best when the bromide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative bromination of the element with bromine or hydrogen bromide, high-temperature bromination of a metal oxide or other halide by bromine, a volatile metal bromide, carbon tetrabromide, or an organic bromide. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Saxony had used the designation as "Free State" from 1918 to 1952.In July 2017, Bavaria's parliament enacted a new revision of the "Gefxc3xa4hrdergesetz", allowing the authorities to imprison a person for a three months term, renewable indefinitely, when s/he hasn't committed a crime but it is assumed that s/he might commit a crime "in the near future".Bavaria has long had one of the largest economies of any region in Germany, and in Europe.Many large companies are headquartered in Bavaria, including Adidas, Allianz, Audi, BMW, Brose, BSH Hausgerxc3xa4te, HypoVereinsbank, Infineon, KUKA, MAN SE, MTU Aero Engines, Munich Re, Osram, Puma, Rohde & Schwarz, Schaeffler, Siemens and Wacker Chemie.With 40& million tourists in 2019, Bavaria is the most visited German state and one of Europe's leading tourist destinations.The unemployment rate stood at 2.6% in October 2018, the lowest in Germany and one of the lowest in the European Union., below the national average of .Another consideration is that Bavarians foster different cultural identities: Franconia in the north, speaking East Franconian German; Bavarian Swabia in the south west, speaking Swabian German; and Altbayern (so-called "Old Bavaria", the regions forming the "historic", pentagon-shaped Bavaria before the acquisitions through the Vienna Congress, at present the districts of the Upper Palatinate, Lower and Upper Bavaria) speaking Austro-Bavarian.In general winter months are seeing more precipitation which is taking the form of rain more often than that of snow compared to the past.Bavaria is divided into seven administrative districts called  (singular ).# Upper Palatinate ()# Upper Bavaria ()# Lower Bavaria ()# Upper Franconia ()# Middle Franconia ()# Lower Franconia ()# Swabia () (districts) are the third communal layer in Bavaria; the others are the  and the  or .The Electorate of the Palatinate by Rhine (Kurpfalz in German) was also acquired by the House of Wittelsbach in 1214, which they would subsequently hold for six centuries.In 1623 the Bavarian duke replaced his relative of the Palatinate branch, the Electorate of the Palatinate in the early days of the Thirty Years' War and acquired the powerful prince-electoral dignity in the Holy Roman Empire, determining its Emperor thence forward, as well as special legal status under the empire's laws.During the early and mid-18th century the ambitions of the Bavarian prince electors led to several wars with Austria as well as occupations by Austria (War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession with the election of a Wittelsbach emperor instead of a Habsburg).b'      DESCRIPTION: State in Germany.{ }Bavaria (; German and Bavarian: Bayern ), officially the Free State of Bavaria (German and Bavarian: Freistaat Bayern ), is a landlocked state of Germany, occupying its southeastern corner. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.In library and booksellers' catalogues, it is common to include an abbreviation such as "Crown 8vo" to indicate the paper size from which the book is made.When rows of books are lined on a book holder, bookends are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting.During the 20th century, librarians were concerned about keeping track of the many books being added yearly to the Gutenberg Galaxy.The more modern codex book format form took over the Roman world by late antiquity, but the scroll format persisted much longer in Asia.Isidore of Seville (d. 636) explained the then-current relation between codex, book and scroll in his Etymologiae (VI.13): "A codex is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll.Lap books are a learning tool created by students.A leveled book collection is a set of books organized in levels of difficulty from the easy books appropriate for an emergent reader to longer more complex books adequate for advanced readers.Typically not the whole collection was available to public, the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft.The beginning of modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns.The advent of paperback books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing.The pages of type were arranged and clamped in a frame, so that when printed on a sheet of paper the full size of the press, the pages would be right side up and in order when the sheet was folded, and the folded edges trimmed.The most common book sizes are:Sizes smaller than 16mo are:Small books can be called booklets.Sizes larger than quarto are:The largest extant medieval manuscript in the world is Codex Gigas 92 xc3x97 50 xc3x97 22& cm.Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book: Machine finished coated papers, woodfree uncoated papers, coated fine papers and special fine papers are common paper grades.Today, the majority of books are printed by offset lithography.Some books, particularly those with shorter runs (i.e. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He voiced his criticism in the form of a poem, equating the romantic view of the battle to watching a "fifth-rate production of Richard III": shabbily costumed actors fight the Battle of Bosworth on-stage while those with lesser roles lounge at the back, showing no interest in the proceedings.In Laurence Olivier's 1955 film adaptation of Richard III, the Battle of Bosworth is represented not by a single duel but a general melee that became the film's most recognised scene and a regular screening at Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre.Richard's vanguard commanded by the Duke of Norfolk was on the right (north) side of Richard's battle line, with the Earl of Northumberland on Richard's left (south) side.Tudor's forces approached along the line of the Roman road and lined up to the west of the present day Fenn Lane Farm, having marched from the vicinity of Merevale in Warwickshire.Although the Battle of Bosworth has only five sentences to direct it, three scenes and more than four hundred lines precede the action, developing the background and motivations for the characters in anticipation of the battle.Shakespeare's account of the battle was mostly based on chroniclers Edward Hall's and Raphael Holinshed's dramatic versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle.When Henry moved to Haverfordwest, the county town of Pembrokeshire, Richard's lieutenant in South Wales, Sir Walter Herbert, failed to move against Henry, and two of his officers, Richard Griffith and Evan Morgan, deserted to Henry with their men.The most important defector to Henry in this early stage of the campaign was probably Rhys ap Thomas, who was the leading figure in West Wales.He could see the Stanleys and their 4,000xe2x80x936,000 men holding positions on and around Dadlington Hill, while to the southwest was Henry's army.Henry's force has been variously estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 men, his original landing force of exiles and mercenaries having been augmented by the recruits gathered in Wales and the English border counties (in the latter area probably mustered chiefly by the Talbot interest), and by deserters from Richard's army. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> When analyzing a pitcher's statistics, some useful categories include K/9IP (strikeouts per nine innings), K/BB (strikeouts per walk), HR/9 (home runs per nine innings), WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched), and OOPS (opponent on-base plus slugging).However, since 2001, more emphasis has been placed on defense-independent pitching statistics, including defense-independent ERA (dERA), in an attempt to evaluate a pitcher's performance regardless of the strength of the defensive players behind them.All of the above statistics may be used in certain game situations. </my-abstract>

<title>Earned run</title>
<wiki-abstract> In baseball, an earned run is any run that was fully enabled by the offensive team's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team.  Conversely, an unearned run is a run that would not have been scored without the aid of an error or a passed ball committed by the defense. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The hit is scored the moment the batter reaches first base safely; if he is put out while attempting to stretch his hit to a double or triple or home run on the same play, he still gets credit for a hit (according to the last base he reached safely on the play).If a batter reaches first base because of offensive interference by a preceding runner (including if a preceding runner is hit by a batted ball), he is also credited with a hit.A hit for one base is called a single, for two bases a double, and for three bases a triple. </my-abstract>

<title>On-base percentage</title>
<wiki-abstract> In baseball statistics, on-base percentage (OBP), also known as on-base average/OBA, measures how frequently a batter reaches base. It is the ratio of the batter's times-on-base (TOB) (the sum of hits, walks, and times hit by pitch) to their number of plate appearances. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Since then, especially since the publication of the influential 2003 book Moneyball which prominently highlighted Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane's focus on the statistic, on-base percentage has seen its perceived importance as a measure of offensive success increase dramatically.Traditionally, players with the best on-base percentages bat as leadoff hitter, unless they are power hitters, who traditionally bat slightly lower in the batting order. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Further, any successful steal on a play resulting in a wild pitch, passed ball, or balk would no longer be credited as a steal, even if the runner had started to steal before the play.One of the largest rewrites to the rules in history came in 1950.There were noted exceptions, such as denying a stolen base to an otherwise successful steal as a part of a double or triple steal, if one other runner was thrown out in the process.A clarification came in 1955 that awarded a stolen base to a runner even if he became involved in a rundown, provided he evaded the rundown and advanced to the base he intended to steal.The criteria for "caught stealing" were fine-tuned in 1979, with a runner being charged with being caught if he is put out while trying to steal, overslides a base (otherwise successfully stolen), or is picked off a base and tries to advance to the next base. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Both ASCII and EBCDIC character codes for the digits, which are examples of zoned BCD, are also shown.As most computers deal with data in 8-bit bytes, it is possible to use one of the following methods to encode a BCD number:As an example, encoding the decimal number <tt>91</tt> using unpacked BCD results in the following binary pattern of two bytes: Decimal:         9         1 Binary : 0000 1001 0000 0001In packed BCD, the same number would fit into a single byte: Decimal:   9    1 Binary: 1001 0001Hence the numerical range for one unpacked BCD byte is zero through nine inclusive, whereas the range for one packed BCD byte is zero through ninety-nine inclusive.To represent numbers larger than the range of a single byte any number of contiguous bytes may be used.For example, the following code (written in C) computes an unsigned 8-digit packed BCD addition using 32-bit binary operations:uint32_t BCDadd(uint32_t a, uint32_t b){    uint32_t t1, t2;    // unsigned 32-bit intermediate values    t1 = a + 0x06666666;    t2 = t1 ^ b;                   // sum without carry propagation    t1 = t1 + b;                   // provisional sum    t2 = t1 ^ t2;                  // all the binary carry bits    t2 = ~t2 & 0x11111110;         // just the BCD carry bits    t2 = (t2 >> 2) | (t2 >> 3);    // correction    return t1 - t2;                // corrected BCD sum}}}BCD is very common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor.In these products, the BCD is usually zoned BCD (as in EBCDIC or ASCII), Packed BCD (two decimal digits per byte), or "pure" BCD encoding (one decimal digit stored as BCD in the low four bits of each byte).Thus the number xe2x88x921,234,567 is 7 digits wide and is encoded as: 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1101 1    2    3    4    5    6    7    xe2x88x92Like character strings, the first byte of the packed decimal that with the most significant two digits is usually stored in the lowest address in memory, independent of the endianness of the machine.In contrast, a 4-byte binary two's complement integer can represent values from xe2x88x922,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.While packed BCD does not make optimal use of storage (using about 20% more memory than binary notation to store the same numbers), conversion to ASCII, EBCDIC, or the various encodings of Unicode is still trivial, as no arithmetic operations are required.So, xe2x88x92432 in signed BCD is 1001 0101 0110 1000.Now that both numbers are represented in signed BCD, they can be added together:   0000 0011 0101 0111   0    3    5    7 + 1001 0101 0110 1000 <u>  9    5    6    8</u> = 1001 1000 1011 1111   9    8    11   15Since BCD is a form of decimal representation, several of the digit sums above are invalid.Thus a zoned decimal value encoded as the hex bytes F1 F2 D3 represents the signed decimal value xe2x88x92123: F1 F2 D3 1  2 xe2x88x923 & (*)(*) Note: These characters vary depending on the local character code page setting.Some languages (such as COBOL and PL/I) directly support fixed-point zoned decimal values, assigning an implicit decimal point at some location between the decimal digits of a number.A variable length Packed BCD numeric data type is also implemented, providing machine instructions that perform arithmetic directly on packed decimal data.On the IBM 1130 and 1800, packed BCD is supported in software by IBM's Commercial Subroutine Package.Today, BCD data is still heavily used in IBM processors and databases, such as IBM DB2, mainframes, and Power6. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its "degenerate art", and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably Jewish influences of "cosmopolitan modernism".The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building, it had some 4,000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 onwards.In 1928, the Hungarian painter Alexander Bortnyik founded a school of design in Budapest called Miihely (also "Muhely"Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Moholy-Nagy re-assembled in Britain during the mid 1930s to live and work in the Isokon project before the war caught up with them.Staff at the Bauhaus included prominent artists such as Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and Lxc3xa1szlxc3xb3 Moholy-Nagy at various points.The school existed in three German citiesxe2x80x94Weimar, from 1919 to 1925; Dessau, from 1925 to 1932; and Berlin, from 1932 to 1933xe2x80x94under three different architect-directors: Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928; Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930; and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Andy Orchard, in A Critical Companion to Beowulf, lists 33 "representative" translations in his bibliography, while the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies published Marijane Osborn's annotated list of over 300 translations and adaptations in 2003.19th centuryIn 1805, the historian Sharon Turner translated selected verses into modern English.20th centuryIn 1909, Francis Barton Gummere's full translation in "English imitative meter" was published, and was used as the text of Gareth Hinds's graphic novel based on Beowulf in 2007.First published in 1928, Frederick Klaeber's Beowulf and The Fight at FinnsburgSeamus Heaney's 1999 translation of the poem (referred to by Howell Chickering and many others as "Heaneywulf") was both praised and criticized.Hence a story about him and his followers may have developed as early as the 6th century.Friedrich Panzer (1910) wrote a thesis that the first part of Beowulf (the Grendel Story) incorporated preexisting folktale material, and that the folktale in question was of the Bear's Son Tale (Bxc3xa4rensohnmxc3xa4rchen) type, which has surviving examples all over the world.This tale type was later catalogued as international folktale type 301, now formally entitled "The Three Stolen Princesses" type in Hans Uther's catalogue, although the "Bear's Son" is still used in Beowulf criticism, if not so much in folkloristic circles.However, although this folkloristic approach was seen as a step in the right direction, "The Bear's Son" tale has later been regarded by many as not a close enough parallel to be a viable choice.D. Fulk, of Indiana University, published the first facing-page edition and translation of the entire Nowell Codex manuscript in the Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library series in 2010.Following research in the King's College London Archives, Carl Kears proposed that John Porter's translation, published in 1975 by Bill Griffiths' Pirate Press, was the first complete verse translation of the poem entirely accompanied by facing-page Old English.Translating Beowulf is one of the subjects of the 2012 publication Beowulf at Kalamazoo, containing a section with 10 essays on translation, and a section with 22 reviews of Heaney's translation (some of which compare Heaney's work with that of Anglo-Saxon scholar Roy Liuzza).J.He noted in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics that as a result the poem's literary value had been largely overlooked and argued that the poem "is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content..."In historical terms, the poem's characters would have been Norse pagans (the historical events of the poem took place before the Christianisation of Scandinavia), yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had mostly converted from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism around the 7th century xe2x80x93 both Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of Germanic paganism. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The film also earned two BAFTA awards nominations, for Best Newcomer (Cleavon Little) and Best Screenplay.The film won the Writers Guild of America Award for "Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen" for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger.In 2006, Blazing Saddles was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:A television pilot titled Black Bart was produced for CBS based on Bergman's original story.The pilot episode of Black Bart was later included as a bonus feature on the Blazing Saddles 30th Anniversary DVD and the Blu-ray disc.In September 2017, Mel Brooks indicated his desire to do a stage play version of Blazing Saddles in the future.The unreleased animated film Blazing Samurai, starring Michael Cera, Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Yeoh, and Ricky Gervais, has been characterized by its creators as "equally inspired by and an homage to Blazing Saddles." </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Bardot wrote a 1999 letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, published in French magazine VSD, in which she accused the Chinese of "torturing bears and killing the world's last tigers and rhinos to make aphrodisiacs".She has donated more than $140,000 over two years for a mass sterilization and adoption program for Bucharest's stray dogs, estimated to number 300,000.In August 2010, Bardot addressed a letter to the Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II of Denmark, appealing for the sovereign to halt the killing of dolphins in the Faroe Islands.The film, about an immoral teenager in a respectable small-town setting, was a huge success, not just in France but also around the world& xe2x80x93 it was among the ten most popular films in Britain in 1957.The Female (1959) for director Julien Duvivier was popular, but Babette Goes to War (1959), a comedy set in World War II, was a huge hit, the fourth biggest movie of the year in France.From 1969 to 1978, Bardot was the official face of Marianne (who had previously been anonymous) to represent the liberty of France.Les Femmes (1969) was a flop, although the screwball comedy The Bear and the Doll (1970) performed slightly better.Bardot is married to Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser of the National Rally, France's main far-right political party.Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born on 28 September 1934 in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, to Louis Bardot (1896xe2x80x931975) and Anne-Marie Mucel (1912xe2x80x931978). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> These techniques are both idiomatic to the banjo in all styles, and their sound is characteristic of bluegrass.Historically, the banjo was played in the claw-hammer style by the Africans who brought their version of the banjo with them. <!-- This section is linked from redirect "Five-string banjo" -->The modern five-string banjo is a variation on Sweeney's original design.New music spurred the creation of "evolutionary variations" of the banjo, from the five-string model current since the 1830s to newer four-string plectrum and tenor banjos.In the post World War 2 years, the banjo experienced a resurgence, played by music stars such as Earl Scruggs (bluegrass), Bela Fleck (jazz, rock, world music), Gerry O'Connor (Celtic and Irish music), Perry Bechtel (jazz, big band), Pete Seeger (folk), and Otis Taylor (African-American roots, blues, jazz).Among these, Pete Seeger and Earl Scruggs were instrumental in turning the situation around.Pete Seeger "was a major force behind a new national interest in folk music.Contemporary and modern works have been written or arranged for the instrument by Jerry Garcia, Buck Trent, Bxc3xa9la Fleck, Tony Trischka, Ralph Stanley, Steve Martin, George Crumb, Modest Mouse, Jo Kondo, Paul Elwood, Hans Werner Henze (notably in his Sixth Symphony), Daniel Mason of Hank Williams III's Damn Band, Beck, the Water Tower Bucket Boys, Todd Taylor, J.P.

<my-abstract> The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:Some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:Writing in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as America's national religion.In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1& billion in 2007.The American Film Institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham (1988) at number 5.Literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop., and W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams).Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland.By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America.In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area,The National Agreement of 1903 formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues.Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were more dominant. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> While this trend is largely attributed to an increased emphasis on recruitment of players from Latin America (with the number of Hispanic players in the major leagues rising to 29% by 2007Arturo Moreno became the first Hispanic owner of an MLB franchise when he purchased the Anaheim Angels in 2004.In 2005, a Racial and Gender Report Card on Major League Baseball was issued, which generally found positive results on the inclusion of African Americans and Latinos in baseball, and gave Major League Baseball a grade of "A" or better for opportunities for players, managers and coaches as well as for MLB's central office.Baseball had been in the West for almost as long as the National League and the American League had been around.The White Sox players all intensely disliked Comiskey and his penurious ways, but were powerless to do anything, thanks to baseball's so-called "reserve clause" that prevented players from switching teams without their team owner's consent.By late 1919, Comiskey's tyrannical reign over the Sox had sown deep bitterness among the players, and White Sox first baseman Arnold "Chick" Gandil decided to conspire to throw the 1919 World Series.The Negro American League of 1951 is considered the last major league season and the last professional club, the Indianapolis Clowns, operated amusingly rather than competitively from the mid-1960s to 1980s.While many of the players that made up the black baseball teams were African-Americans, many more were Latin Americans from nations that deliver some of the greatest talents that make up the major league rosters of today.The eventual consequences for the game, the players and the fans were substantial.A memo circulated in 1991 by baseball commissioner Fay Vincent stated that "The possession, sale or use of any illegal drug or controlled substance by Major League players and personnel is strictly prohibited ... [and those players involved] are subject to discipline by the Commissioner and risk permanent expulsion from the game....The term may be used broadly to include professional black teams outside the leagues and it may be used narrowly for the seven relatively successful leagues beginning 1920 that are sometimes termed "Negro major leagues".The first professional team, established in 1885, achieved great and lasting success as the Cuban Giants, while the first league, the National Colored Base Ball League, failed in 1887 after only two weeks due to low attendance.However, recent steroid allegations have marred the season in the minds of many fans.That same year, the expansion New York Yankees won a record 125 games, including going 11xe2x80x932 in the postseason, to win the World Series as what many consider to be one of the greatest teams of all time.McGwire's record of 70 would last a mere three years following the meteoric rise of veteran San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry Bonds in 2001.Semi-professional baseball clubs followed in the 1860s, and the first professional leagues arrived in the post-American Civil War 1870s.The earliest known mention of baseball in the US is either a 1786 diary entry by a Princeton student who describes playing "baste ball,"The first team to play baseball under modern rules is believed to be the New York Knickerbockers. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Boston wound up winning three out of four games in Allegheny City.Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss added his share of the gate receipts to the players' share, so the losing team's players actually finished with a larger individual share than the winning team's.The Series brought the new American League prestige and proved its best could beat the best of the National League, thus strengthening the demand for future World Series competitions.In 1901, Ban Johnson, president of the Western League, a minor league organization, formed the American League to take advantage of the National League's 1900 contraction from twelve teams to eight.Boston bookies actually gave even odds to the teams (and only because Dreyfuss and other "sports" were alleged to have bet on Pittsburgh to bring down the odds).Saturday, October 3, 1903, at Huntington Avenue Baseball Grounds in Boston, MassachusettsPhillippe, pitching after only a single day of rest, started Game 3 for the Pirates and didn't let them down, hurling his second complete game victory of the Series to put Pittsburgh up two games to one.Tuesday, October 6, 1903, at Exposition Park (III) in Allegheny, PennsylvaniaAfter two days of rest, Phillippe was ready to pitch a second straight game. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This differs from Raymond's theory in The Cathedral and the Bazaar, which having been written before there was much business involvement in open source, explains open source as a consequence of programmer motivation and leisure.In February 2008, for the 10th anniversary of the phrase "open source", Perens published a message to the community called "State of Open Source Message: A New Decade For Open Source".Bruce Perens supported Bernie Sanders for President Perens endorsed Clinton.Perens is an avid amateur radio enthusiast (call sign K6BP) and maintained technocrat.net, which he closed in late 2008, because its revenues did not cover its costs.Perens is featured in the 2001 documentary film Revolution OS and the 2006 BBC television documentary The Code-Breakers.From 2002 to 2006, Prentice Hall PTR published the Bruce Perens' Open Source Series, a set of 24 books covering various open source software tools, for which Perens served as the series editor.He promotes open radio communications standardsIn 2016 Perens, along with Boalt Hall (Berkeley Law) professor Lothar Determann, co-authored "Open Cars" which appeared in the Berkeley Technology Law Journal.In 2018 Perens founded the Open Research Institute (ORI), a non-profit research and development organization to address technologies involving Open Source, Open Hardware, Open Standards, Open Content, and Open Access to Research.He was fired as a result of his anti-Microsoft statements, which especially became an issue after HP acquired Compaq, a major manufacturer of Microsoft Windows-based PCs, in 2002.In 1998, Perens founded, and became the first project leader, of the Linux Standard Base project, a joint project by several Linux distributions now under the organizational structure of the Linux Foundation to standardize the Linux software system structure.In 2003 Perens created UserLinux, a Debian-based distribution whose stated goal was, "Provide businesses with freely available, high quality Linux operating systems accompanied by certifications, service, and support options designed to encourage productivity and security while reducing overall costs." </my-abstract>

<title>Bundle theory</title>
<wiki-abstract> Bundle theory, originated by the 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, is the ontological theory about objecthood in which an object consists only of a collection (bundle) of properties, relations or tropes. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> In particular, there is no substance in which the properties are inherent.The difficulty in conceiving of or describing an object without also conceiving of or describing its properties is a common justification for bundle theory, especially among current philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition.The inability to comprehend any aspect of the thing other than its properties implies, this argument maintains, that one cannot conceive of a bare particular (a substance without properties), an implication that directly opposes substance theory. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> At the end of their meeting, Montgomery asked Dayan to tell the Americans, in his name, that they were "insane".During a visit to the Alamein battlefields in May 1967, he bluntly told high-ranking Egyptian Army officers that they would lose any war with Israel, a warning that was shown to be justified only a few weeks later in the Six-Day War.In retirement Montgomery publicly supported apartheid after a visit to South Africa in 1962, and after a visit to China declared himself impressed by the Chinese leadership.He spoke out against the legalisation of homosexuality in the United Kingdom, arguing that the Sexual Offences Act 1967 was a "charter for buggery"Montgomery was a teetotaler, a vegetarian.File:Montgomery grave2.jpg|Montgomery's grave, Holy Cross churchyard, BinstedFile:Warwick, Collegiate Church of St Mary, interior - 1st Visc Montgomery of Alamein's Garter Banner 2018.png|Montgomery's Garter banner on display in St Mary's, Warwick.File:Statue de Bernard Montgomery.jpg|Statue of Bernard Montgomery in Montgomery Square, BrusselsViscount Montgomery's ribbons as they would appear today, not including campaign or other awards.'The two armies linked up on 1 April 1945, encircling 370,000 German troops, and on 4 April 1945, US Ninth Army reverted to Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group.By the war's end, the remaining formations of 21st Army group, First Canadian Army and British Second Army, had liberated the northern part of the Netherlands and captured much of north-west Germany, occupied Hamburg and Rostock and sealed off the Danish peninsula.On 4 May 1945, on Lxc3xbcneburg Heath, Montgomery accepted the surrender of German forces in north-west Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.The British high command were not only concerned with winning the war and defeating Germany, but also with ensuring that it retained sufficient influence in the post-war world to govern global policy.Montgomery had little respect for the Canadian generals, whom he dismissed as mediocre, except for Simonds, whom he consistently praised as Canada's only "first-rate" general in the entire war.Admiral Ramsay, who proved to be a far more articulate and forceful champion of the Canadians than their own generals, starting on 9 October demanded of Eisenhower in a meeting that he either order Montgomery to make supporting the First Canadian Army in the Scheldt fighting his number one priority or sack him.A chastised Montgomery told Eisenhower on 15 October 1944 that he was now making clearing the Scheldt his "top priority", and the ammunition shortages in the First Canadian Army, a problem which he denied even existed five days earlier, were now over as supplying the Canadians was henceforth his first concern.On 16 December 1944, at the start of the Battle of the Bulge, Montgomery's 21st Army Group was on the northern flank of the allied lines.This included temporary command of the US First Army and the US Ninth Army, which held up the German advance to the north of the Bulge while the US Third Army under Patton relieved Bastogne from the south.Montgomery's 21st Army Group, including the US Ninth Army and the First Allied Airborne Army, crossed the Rhine in Operation Plunder in March 1945, two weeks after the US First Army had crossed the Rhine in the Battle of Remagen.The American LIFE magazine quoted Bradley in 1951:With Goodwood drawing the Wehrmacht towards the British sector, the First American Army enjoyed a two-to-one numerical superiority with General Omar Bradley accepting Montgomery's advice to begin the offensive by concentrating at one point instead of a "broad front" as Eisenhower would have preferred.Operation Goodwood almost cost Montgomery his job, as Eisenhower seriously considered sacking him and only chose not to do so because to sack the popular "Monty" would have caused such a political backlash in Britain against the Americans at a critical moment in the war that the resulting strains in the Atlantic alliance were not considered worth it.Many American officers had found Montgomery a difficult man to work with, and after Goodwood, pressured Eisenhower to fire Montgomery.Omar Bradley's US 12th Army Group was to Montgomery's south, with William Simpson's US Ninth Army adjacent to 21st Army Group, Courtney Hodges' US First Army, holding the Ardennes and George S. Patton's US Third Army further south.SHAEF believed the Wehrmacht was no longer capable of launching a major offensive, and that no offensive could be launched through such rugged terrain as the Ardennes Forest.Montgomery bitterly resented this change, although it had been agreed before the D-Day invasion.Winston Churchill had Montgomery promoted to field marshalOn 3 September 1944 Hitler ordered the 15th German Army, which had been stationed in the Pas de Calais region and was withdrawing north into the Low Countries to hold the mouth of the river Scheldt to deprive the Allies of the use of Antwerp.On 6 September 1944, Montgomery told Crerar that "I want Boulogne badly" and that city should be taken no matter what the cost.On 9 September, Montgomery wrote to Brooke that "one good Pas de Calais port" would be sufficient to meet all the logistical needs of the 21st Army Group, but only the supply needs of the same formation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Because of this problem several methods to estimate confidence intervals have been proposed.In the equations for confidence intervals below, the variables have the following meaning:If X& ~& B(n,& p) and Y& ~& B(m,& p) are independent binomial variables with the same probability p, then X& +& Y  is again a binomial variable; its distribution is Z=X+Y& ~& B(n+m,& p):  operatorname P(Z=k) &= sum_{i=0}^kleft[binom{n}i p^i (1-p)^{n-i}right]left[binom{m}{k-i} p^{k-i} (1-p)^{m-k+i}right]                       &= binom{n+m}k p^k (1-p)^{n+m-k}end{align}</math>However, if X and Y do not have the same probability p, then the variance of the sum will be smaller than the variance of a binomial variable distributed as <math>B(n+m, bar{p}).,</math>This result was first derived by Katz and coauthors in 1978.Since <math> X sim B(n, p) </math> and <math> Y sim B(X, q) </math>, by the law of total probability,   Pr[Y = m] &= sum_{k = m}^{n} Pr[Y = m mid X = k] Pr[X = k] [2pt]   &= sum_{k=m}^n binom{n}{k} binom{k}{m} p^k q^m (1-p)^{n-k} (1-q)^{k-m} end{align}</math>Since <math>tbinom{n}{k} tbinom{k}{m} = tbinom{n}{m} tbinom{n-m}{k-m},</math> the equation above can be expressed asFactoring <math> p^k = p^m p^{k-m} </math> and pulling all the terms that don't depend on <math> k </math> out of the sum now yields   Pr[Y = m] &= binom{n}{m} p^m q^m left( sum_{k=m}^n binom{n-m}{k-m} p^{k-m} (1-p)^{n-k} (1-q)^{k-m} right) [2pt]   &= binom{n}{m} (pq)^m left( sum_{k=m}^n binom{n-m}{k-m} left(p(1-q)right)^{k-m} (1-p)^{n-k}  right) end{align}</math>After substituting <math> i = k - m </math> in the expression above, we getNotice that the sum (in the parentheses) above equals <math> (p - pq + 1 - p)^{n-m} </math> by the binomial theorem.b'      DESCRIPTION: Probability distribution.{{Probability distribution  | name       = Binomial distribution  | type       = mass  | pdf_image  =   | cdf_image  =   | notation   = <math>B(n,p)</math>  | parameters = <math>n in {0, 1, 2, ldots}</math> &ndash;

<my-abstract> Popular descriptions of positions include:Point guard (often called the "1") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.Shooting guard (the "2") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.Small forward (the "3") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.Power forward (the "4"): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).Center (the "5"): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.The above descriptions are flexible.For the offense, a violation of these rules results in loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds.There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high school for both sexes), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA, the NBA, and U Sports (Canadian universities) play for both sexes, and 30 seconds in NCAA play for both sexes), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane, (or the "key") (3 seconds).In the NBA and NCAA the court is .The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession.)If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot.This violation is incurred when a player touches the ball on its downward trajectory to the basket, unless it is obvious that the ball has no chance of entering the basket, if a player touches the ball while it is in the rim, or in the area extended upwards from the basket, or if a player reaches through the basket to interfere with the shot. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The letter  and, for example, is used to write words with the sequence a-n-d in them, such as  hand.Most braille embossers support between 34 and 40 cells per line, and 25 lines per page.A manually operated Perkins braille typewriter supports a maximum of 42 cells per line (its margins are adjustable), and typical paper allows 25 lines per page.A large interlining Stainsby has 36 cells per line and 18 lines per page.An A4-sized Marburg braille frame, which allows interpoint braille (dots on both sides of the page, offset so they do not interfere with each other), has 30 cells per line and 27 lines per page.A Braille writing machine is a typewriter with six keys that allow to write in Braille alphabet on a regular white page.The first Braille typewriter to gain general acceptance was invented by Frank Haven Hall (Superintendent of the Illinois School for the Blind), and was presented to the public in 1892.In 1951 David Abraham, a woodworking teacher at the Perkins School for the Blind produced a more advanced Braille typewriter, the Perkins Brailler.In 2011 David S. Morgan produced the first SMART Brailler machine, with added text to speech function and allowed digital capture of data entered.Braille is usually read in printed forms such as paper books written in braille, braille public signals and also on Braille e-books.)Historically, there have been three principles in assigning the values of a linear script (print) to Braille:  Using Louis Braille's original French letter values; reassigning the braille letters according to the sort order of the print alphabet being transcribed; and reassigning the letters to improve the efficiency of writing in braille.Under international consensus, most braille alphabets follow the French sorting order for the 26 letters of the basic Latin alphabet, and there have been attempts at unifying the letters beyond these 26 (see international braille), though differences remain, for example in German Braille and the contractions of English Braille.Children who are blind or visually impaired can begin learning pre-braille skills from a very young age to become fluent braille readers as they get older.In 1960, 50% of legally blind, school-age children were able to read braille in the U.S.There are numerous causes for the decline in braille usage, including school budget constraints, technology advancements such as screen-reader software, and different philosophical views over how blind children should be educated.A key turning point for braille literacy was the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an act of Congress that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools.In 1998 there were 57,425 legally blind students registered in the United States, but only 10% (5,461) of them used braille as their primary reading medium.Early Braille education is crucial to literacy for a blind or low-vision child.Interpoint refers to braille printing that is offset, so that the paper can be embossed on both sides, with the dots on one side appearing between the divots that form the dots on the other.Using a computer or other electronic device, Braille may be produced with a braille embosser (printer) or a refreshable braille display (screen).Braille has been extended to an 8-dot code, particularly for use with braille embossers and refreshable braille displays.This unification avoids the chaos of each nation reordering the braille code to match the sorting order of its print alphabet, as happened in Algerian Braille, where braille codes were numerically reassigned to match the order of the Arabic alphabet and bear little relation to the values used in other countries (compare modern Arabic Braille, which uses the French sorting order), and as happened in an early American version of English Braille, where the letters w, x, y, z were reassigned to match English alphabetical order. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> For infinite sets, the picture is more complicated, leading to the concept of cardinal numberxe2x80x94a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.A bijective function from a set to itself is also called a permutation, and the set of all permutations of a set forms a symmetry group.Bijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of isomorphism, homeomorphism, diffeomorphism, permutation group, and projective map.For a pairing between X and Y (where Y need not be different from X) to be a bijection, four properties must hold:# each element of X must be paired with at least one element of Y,# no element of X may be paired with more than one element of Y,# each element of Y must be paired with at least one element of X, and# no element of Y may be paired with more than one element of X.Satisfying properties (1) and (2) means that a pairing is a function with domain X.Since this function is a bijection, it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position.The composition <math>scriptstyle g ,circ, f</math> of two bijections f: X xe2x86x92 Y and g: Y xe2x86x92 Z is a bijection, whose inverse is given by <math>scriptstyle g ,circ, f</math> is <math>scriptstyle (g ,circ, f)^{-1} ;=; (f^{-1}) ,circ, (g^{-1})</math>.A bijection composed of an injection (left) and a surjection (right).Conversely, if the composition <math>scriptstyle g , circ, f</math> of two functions is bijective, it only follows that f is injective and g is surjective.If X and Y are finite sets, then there exists a bijection between the two sets X and Y if and only if X and Y have the same number of elements. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Thus, for the general, non-associative case, binary operations can be represented with binary trees.However:A binary operation f on a set S may be viewed as a ternary relation on S, that is, the set of triples (a, b, f(a,b)) in S xc3x97 S xc3x97 S for all a and b in S.An external binary operation is a binary function from K &times; S to S.  This differs from a binary operation on a set in the sense in that K need not be S; its elements come from outside.An example of an external binary operation is scalar multiplication in linear algebra. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the citric acid cycle, producing two molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via FADH as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide.Enzymes called transaminases can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an xcexb1-keto acid) to another xcexb1-keto acid (making it an amino acid).While they can synthesize arginine and histidine, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.If the amino group is removed from an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon skeleton called an xcexb1-keto acid. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> If a player does not lift, their only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt, this is called a net shot; in the midcourt or rear court, it is often called a push or block.When the shuttlecock is near to net height, players can hit drives, which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rear court.China, Denmark, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, South Korea, Taiwan (as Chinese Taipei) and Japan are the nations which have consistently produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in men's and women's competition recently.The game has also become a popular backyard sport in the United States.The following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication, Laws of Badminton.Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points).Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.In the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a round-the-head forehand overhead (a forehand "on the backhand side") rather than attempt a backhand overhead.Lifted serves may be either high serves, where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or flick serves, where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.Once players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. </my-abstract>

<title>Boolean algebra (structure)</title>
<wiki-abstract> In abstract algebra, a Boolean algebra or Boolean lattice is a complemented distributive lattice. This type of algebraic structure captures essential properties of both set operations and logic operations. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The categories of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras are equivalent.Hsiang (1985) gave a rule-based algorithm to check whether two arbitrary expressions denote the same value in every Boolean ring.Hsiang (1985) gave a confluent and terminating rewrite system for Boolean rings, thus solving their word problem: to check whether two arbitrary expressions s and t denote the same value in every Boolean ring, apply rewrite rules to s as long as possible, resulting in an expression s are literally identical, except for different parenthezation and order of operands of "+" or "xc2xb7".--->More generally, Boudet, Jouannaud, and Schmidt-Schauxc3x9f (1989) gave an algorithm to solve equations between arbitrary Boolean-ring expressions.Employing the similarity of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras, both algorithms have applications in automated theorem proving.An ideal of the Boolean algebra A is a subset I such that for all x, y in I we have x xe2x88xa8 y in I and for all a in A we have a xe2x88xa7 x in I.In the 1960s, Paul Cohen, Dana Scott, and others found deep new results in mathematical logic and axiomatic set theory using offshoots of Boolean algebra, namely forcing and Boolean-valued models.A Boolean algebra is a six-tuple consisting of a set A, equipped with two binary operations xe2x88xa7 (called "meet" or "and"), xe2x88xa8 (called "join" or "or"), a unary operation xc2xac (called "complement" or "not") and two elements 0 and 1 in A (called "bottom" and "top", or "least" and "greatest" element, also denoted by the symbols xe2x8axa5 and xe2x8axa4, respectively), such that for all elements a, b and c of A, the following axioms hold:Note, however, that the absorption law and even the associativity law can be excluded from the set of axioms as they can be derived from the other axioms (see Proven properties).A Boolean algebra with only one element is called a trivial Boolean algebra or a degenerate Boolean algebra. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> During the first asaxe1xb9x83khyeya he is said to have encountered and served 75,000 Buddhas, and 76,000 in the second, after which he received his first prediction (vyxc4x81karaxe1xb9x87a) of future Buddhahood from Dxc4xabpankara, meaning that he could no longer fall back from the path to Buddhahood.The Mahxc4x81vastu of the Mahxc4x81sxc4x81xe1xb9x83ghika-Lokottaravxc4x81dins presents four stages of the bodhisattva path without giving specific time frames (though it's said to take various asaxe1xb9x83khyeya kalpas):# Natural (prakxe1xb9x9bti), one first plants the roots of merit in front of a Buddha to attain Buddhahood.# Resolution (praxe1xb9x87idhxc4x81na), one makes their first resolution to attain Buddhahood in the presence of a Buddha.# Continuing (anuloma), one continues to practice until one meets a Buddha who confirms one's future Buddhahood.# Irreversible (anivartana), at this stage, one cannot fall back.Probable early image of a bodhisattva (Bimaran casket, 50 CE).b'      DESCRIPTION: Any person who is on the path towards Buddhahood but has not yet attained it.{ }In Buddhism, a bodhisattva ( ) is any person who is on the path towards Buddhahood.In the Early Buddhist schools as well as modern Theravada Buddhism, a bodhisattva (Pali: bodhisatta) refers to anyone who has made a resolution to become a Buddha and has also received a confirmation or prediction from a living Buddha that this will be so.In Mahayana Buddhism, a bodhisattva refers to anyone who has generated bodhicitta, a spontaneous wish and compassionate mind to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings.The elaborate concept refers to a sentient being or sattva that develops bodhi or enlightenment xe2x80x94 thus possessing the boddisattva's psyche; described as those who work to develop and exemplify the loving-kindness (metta), compassion (karuxe1xb9x87xc4x81), empathetic joy (mudita) and equanimity (upekkha).)Before a bodhisattva arrives at the first ground, he or she first must travel the first two of five paths:#the path of accumulation#the path of preparationThe ten grounds of the bodhisattva then can be grouped into the next three paths:#bhxc5xabmi 1 the path of insight#bhxc5xabmis 2xe2x80x937 the path of meditation#bhxc5xabmis 8xe2x80x9310 the path of no more learningThe chapter of ten grounds in the Avataxe1xb9x83saka Sxc5xabtra refers to 52 stages.They are:# King-like bodhicitta xe2x80x93 To aspire to become a Buddha first in order to then help sentient beings.# Boatman-like bodhicitta xe2x80x93 To aspire to become a Buddha at the same time as other sentient beings.# Shepherd-like bodhicitta xe2x80x93 To aspire to become a Buddha only after all other sentient beings have done so.These three are not types of people, but rather types of motivation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, in 1826, while the work was in progress, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash.Buckingham Palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria,By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family,Before Prince Albert's death, the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments,Widowed in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at Windsor Castle, Balmoral Castle and Osborne House.Buckingham Palacexe2x80x94the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the Belle xc3x89poque cream and gold colour scheme they retain todayxe2x80x94once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel King Edward's heavy redecorations were at odds with Nash's original work.The last major building work took place during the reign of King George& V when, in 1913, Sir& Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire.Eventually, in the late 17th& century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir& Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies.Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir& William Blake, around 1624.When the improvident Goring defaulted on his rentsUnder the new Crown ownership, the building was originally intended as a private retreat for King George& III's wife, Queen Charlotte, and was accordingly known as The Queen's House. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> British Airways is the first passenger airline to have generated more than $1 billion on a single air route in a year (from 1 April 2017, to 31 March 2018, on the New York-JFK - London-Heathrow route).BA was created in 1974 after a British Airways Board was established by the British government to manage the two nationalised airline corporations, British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways, and two regional airlines, Cambrian Airways and Northeast Airlines.It flies 17 Embraer E-170/E-190 aircraft and two leased Saab 2000.In March 2015, Qatar Airways purchased a 10% stake in International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, for xe2x82xac1.2 billion (US$1.26 billion).BEA Helicopters was renamed British Airways Helicopters in 1974 and operated passenger and offshore oil support services until it was sold in 1986.South Africa's Comair and Denmark's Sun Air of Scandinavia have been franchisees of British Airways since 1996.British Airways Limited was established in 2012 to take over the operation of the premium service between London City Airport and New York-JFK.However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.Consequently, it was only following the recommendations of the 1969 Edwards Report that a new British Airways Board, managing both BEA and BOAC, and the two regional British airlines Cambrian Airways based at Cardiff, and Northeast Airlines based at Newcastle upon Tyne, was constituted on 1 April 1972.Following two years of fierce competition with British Caledonian, the second-largest airline in the United Kingdom at the time, the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so that the two carriers would no longer compete on long-haul routes.British Airways and Air France operated the supersonic airliner Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde, and the world's first supersonic passenger service flew in January 1976 from Heathrow Airport to Bahrain International Airport.In 1981 the airline was instructed to prepare for privatisation by the Conservative Thatcher government. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He also collated the various editions of the Book of Mormon down to the present to see what sorts of changes have been made through time.Thus far, Skousen has published complete transcripts of the Original and Printer's Manuscripts,Differences between the original and printer's manuscript, the 1830 printed version, and modern versions of the Book of Mormon have led some critics to claim that evidence has been systematically removed that could have proven that Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon, or are attempts to hide embarrassing aspects of the church's past,The LDS version of the Book of Mormon has been translated into 83 languages and selections have been translated into an additional 25 languages.The majority of what remains of the original manuscript is now kept in the LDS Church's Archives.The second completed manuscript, called the printer's manuscript, was a copy of the original manuscript produced by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes.Critical comparisons between surviving portions of the manuscripts show an average of two to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as misspellings or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the meaning of the text.The printer's manuscript was not used fully in the typesetting of the 1830 version of Book of Mormon; portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting.This passage is sometimes referred to as "Moroni's Promise".As of October 2020, the LDS Church has published more than 192 million copies of the Book of Mormon.The Community of Christ, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, Herald House: the Authorized Edition, which is based on the original printer's manuscript, and the 1837 Second Edition (or "Kirtland Edition") of the Book of Mormon.The two most significant are the LDS system, introduced in 1879, and the RLDS system, which is based on the original 1830 chapter divisions.The RLDS 1908 edition, RLDS 1966 edition, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) edition, and Restored Covenant editions use the RLDS system while most other current editions use the LDS system.The Book of Mormon is currently printed by the following publishers:The following non-current editions marked major developments in the text or reader's helps printed in the Book of Mormon.The following versions are published online:Although some earlier unpublished studies had been prepared, not until the early 1970s was true textual criticism applied to the Book of Mormon.Numerous observers have suggested that the Book of Mormon parallels others within the 19th-century "mound-builder" genre that was pervasive at the time.Joseph Smith characterized the Book of Mormon as the "keystone" of Mormonism, and claimed that it was "the most correct of any book on earth".The Book of Mormon is one of four sacred texts or standard works of the LDS Church.The importance of the Book of Mormon was a focus of Ezra Taft Benson, the church's thirteenth president. </my-abstract>

<title>Baptists</title>
<wiki-abstract> Baptists form a major branch of Protestantism distinguished by baptizing professing Christian believers only (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and doing so by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or aspersion). Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency (the responsibility and accountability of every person before God), sola fide (salvation by faith alone), sola scriptura (scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice) and congregationalist church government. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The largest communities that are part of the Baptist World Alliance are in Nigeria (3.5 million) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (2 million) in Africa, India (2.5 million) and Myanmar (1 million) in Asia, the United States (35 million) and Brazil (1.8 million) in the Americas.In 1991, Ukraine had the second largest Baptist community in the world, behind only the United States.A large percentage of Baptists in North America are found in six bodiesxe2x80x94the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC); American Baptist Association (ABA); National Baptist Convention (NBC); National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.; (NBCA); American Baptist Churches USA (ABC); and Baptist Bible Fellowship International (BBFI).There are four states in the world where Baptists make up more than 40% of the population: Mississippi (48%),Membership policies vary due to the autonomy of churches, but the traditional method by which an individual becomes a member of a church is through believer's baptism (which is a public profession of faith in Jesus, followed by water baptism).Baptists, like other Christians, are defined by school of thoughtxe2x80x94some of it common to all orthodox and evangelical groups and a portion of it distinctive to Baptists.Shared doctrines would include beliefs about one God; the virgin birth; miracles; atonement for sins through the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of Jesus; the Trinity; the need for salvation (through belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, his death and resurrection); grace; the Kingdom of God; last things (eschatology) (Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to the earth, the dead will be raised, and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness); and evangelism and missions.Some historically significant Baptist doctrinal documents include the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith, 1742 Philadelphia Baptist Confession, the 1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith, the Southern Baptist Convention's Baptist Faith and Message, and written church covenants which some individual Baptist churches adopt as a statement of their faith and beliefs.Most Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church.The resolution marked the denomination's first formal acknowledgment that racism played a role in its founding.Southern Baptist Landmarkism sought to reset the ecclesiastical separation which had characterized the old Baptist churches, in an era when inter-denominational union meetings were the order of the day.The Northern Baptist Convention in the United States had internal conflict over modernism in the early 20th century, ultimately embracing it. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Its culture blends Northeastern and Midwestern traditions, with annual festivals including Taste of Buffalo and Allentown Art Festival, two professional sports teams and a Division I college team (Buffalo Bills, Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bulls) and a thriving and progressive music and arts scene.The city of Buffalo received its name from a nearby creek called Buffalo Creek.British military engineer Captain John Montresor made reference to "Buffalo Creek" in his 1764 journal, which may be the earliest recorded appearance of the name.There are several theories regarding how Buffalo Creek received its name.The first inhabitants of the New York State are believed to have been nomadic Paleo-Indians, who migrated after the disappearance of Pleistocene glaciers during or before 7000 BCE.Around 1000 CE, the Woodland period began, marked by the rise of the Iroquois Confederacy and its tribes throughout the state.During French exploration of the region in 1620, the region was occupied simultaneously by the agrarian Erie people, a tribe outside of the Five Nations of the Iroquois southwest of Buffalo Creek, and the Wenro people or Wenrohronon, an Iroquoian-speaking tribal offshoot of the large Neutral Nation who lived along the inland south shore of Lake Ontario and at the east end of Lake Erie and a bit of its northern shore.Buffalo is also home to several minor sports teams, including the Buffalo Bisons (baseball; an affiliate of the MLB's Toronto Blue Jays since 2014), FC Buffalo (soccer) as well as a professional women's team, the Buffalo Beauts (hockey). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Franklin, Printer.'In 1732, Ben Franklin published the first German-language newspaper in America xe2x80x93 Die Philadelphische Zeitung xe2x80x93 although it failed after only one year because four other newly founded German papers quickly dominated the newspaper market.When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two "wretched little" news sheets, Andrew Bradford's The American Weekly Mercury, and Samuel Keimer's Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette.He belonged to a gentleman's club (which he called "the honest Whigs"), which held stated meetings, and included members such as Richard Price, the minister of Newington Green Unitarian Church who ignited the Revolution controversy, and Andrew Kippis.In 1763, Franklin's illegitimate son William Franklin, by then an attorney and assistant to Franklin's colonial advocacy in London, was appointed Colonial Governor of New Jersey.In 1756, Franklin had become a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce (now the Royal Society of Arts or RSA), which had been founded in 1754 and whose early meetings took place in Covent Garden coffee shops.He himself fathered an illegitimate son, William Temple Franklin, born on the same date, February 22, 1760.A Loyalist to the king, William Franklin and his father Benjamin eventually broke relations over their differences about the American Revolutionary War, as Benjamin Franklin could never accept William's position.Franklin's Boston trust fund accumulated almost $5,000,000 during that same time; at the end of its first 100 years a portion was allocated to help establish a trade school that became the Franklin Institute of Boston, and the whole fund was later dedicated to supporting this institute."Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress" is a letter written by Benjamin Franklin, dated June 25, 1745, in which Franklin gives advice to a young man about channeling sexual urges.He initially owned and dealt in slaves but, by the late 1750s, he began arguing against slavery, became an abolitionist, and promoted education and the integration of blacks in American Society.His life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on the fifty-cent piece, the $100 bill, warships, and the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as numerous cultural references.Benjamin Franklin's father, Josiah Franklin, was a tallow chandler, soaper, and candlemaker.The British edition of the chart, which was the original, was so thoroughly ignored that everyone assumed it was lost forever until Phil Richardson, a Woods Hole oceanographer and Gulf Stream expert, discovered it in the Bibliothxc3xa8que Nationale in Paris in 1980.It took many years for British sea captains to adopt Franklin's advice on navigating the current; once they did, they were able to trim two weeks from their sailing time.1785: Benjamin Franklin's "Sundry Maritime Observations," The Academy of Natural Sciences, April 1939& m</ref> In 1853, the oceanographer and cartographer Matthew Fontaine Maury noted that while Franklin charted and codified the Gulf Stream, he did not discover it:Franklin was, along with his contemporary Leonhard Euler, the only major scientist who supported Christiaan Huygens's wave theory of light, which was basically ignored by the rest of the scientific community.Franklin appears on the $1,000 Series EE Savings bond.In 1976, as part of a bicentennial celebration, Congress dedicated a  marble statue in Philadelphia's Franklin Institute as the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial.Deborah Read Franklin died of a stroke in 1774, while Franklin was on an extended mission to England; he returned in 1775.In 1730, 24-year-old Franklin publicly acknowledged the existence of his son William, who was deemed "illegitimate," as he was born out of wedlock, and raised him in his household. </my-abstract>

<title>Banach space</title>
<wiki-abstract> In mathematics, more specifically in functional analysis, a Banach space (pronounced ) is a complete normed vector space. Thus, a Banach space is a vector space with a metric that allows the computation of vector length and distance between vectors and is complete in the sense that a Cauchy sequence of vectors always converges to a well defined limit that is within the space. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The mapping  is a linear bijection from  onto the range , whose inverse need not be bounded.Basic examples of Banach spaces include: the  spaces and their special cases, the sequence spaces  that consist of scalar sequences indexed by Natural number|; among them, the space  of absolutely summable sequences and the space  of square summable sequences; the space  of sequences tending to zero and the space  of bounded sequences; the space  of continuous scalar functions on a compact Hausdorff space , equipped with the max norm,According to the Banachxe2x80x93Mazur theorem, every Banach space is isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of some .Any Hilbert space serves as an example of a Banach space.Thus, the vector space  can be given the operator normFor  a Banach space, the space  is a Banach space with respect to this norm.If  is a Banach space, the space  B(X, X)}} forms a unital Banach algebra; the multiplication operation is given by the composition of linear maps.If  and  are normed spaces, they are isomorphic normed spaces if there exists a linear bijection  such that  and its inverse  are continuous.A normed space  is a Banach space if and only if each absolutely convergent series in  converges in ,Every normed space can be isometrically embedded onto a dense vector subspace of some Banach space, where this Banach space is called a completion of the normed space.Since  is a Banach space (using the absolute value as norm), the dual  is a Banach space, for every normed space .The main tool for proving the existence of continuous linear functionals is the Hahnxe2x80x93Banach theorem.In particular, every continuous linear functional on a subspace of a normed space can be continuously extended to the whole space, without increasing the norm of the functional.A Hilbert space  on  R, C}} is complete for a norm of the formwhereis the inner product, linear in its first argument that satisfies the following:forall x, y in H: quad langle y, x rangle &= overline{langle x, y rangle}, forall x in H: quad langle x, x rangle &ge 0, langle x,x rangle = 0 Leftrightarrow x &= 0.end{align}</math>For example, the space  is a Hilbert space.The Hardy spaces, the Sobolev spaces are examples of Banach spaces that are related to  spaces and have additional structure.This result implies that the metric in Banach spaces, and more generally in normed spaces, completely captures their linear structure.Finite dimensional Banach spaces are homeomorphic as topological spaces, if and only if they have the same dimension as real vector spaces.Andersonxe2x80x93Kadec theorem (1965xe2x80x9366) proves that any two Banach spaces are homeomorphic if and only if  they have the same density character, the minimum cardinality of a dense subset.When two compact Hausdorff spaces  and  are homeomorphic, the Banach spaces  and  are isometric.The space  of all linear maps from  to the underlying field  (this space  is called the algebraic dual space, to distinguish it from ) also induces a topology on  which is finer than the weak topology, and much less used in functional analysis.On a dual space , there is a topology weaker than the weak topology of , called weak* topology.The dual of  is isometrically isomorphic to .The dual of a separable Banach space need not be separable, but:When  is separable, the above criterion for totality can be used for proving the existence of a countable total subset in .The weak topology on a Banach space  is the coarsest topology on  for which all elements  in the continuous dual space  are continuous. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> For example, a bid of 2NT immediately after partner's 1NT not only shows a balanced hand of a certain point range, but also would almost always deny possession of a five-card major suit (otherwise the player would have bid it) or even a four card major suit (in that case, the player would probably have used the Stayman convention).Likewise, in some partnerships the bid of 2 in the sequence 1NTxe2x80x932xe2x80x932xe2x80x932 between partners (opponents passing throughout) explicitly shows five hearts but also confirms four cards in spades: the bidder must hold at least five hearts to make it worth looking for a heart fit after 2 denied a four card major, and with at least five hearts, a Stayman bid must have been justified by having exactly four spades, the other major (since Stayman (as used by this partnership) is not useful with anything except a four card major suit).Terence Reese, a prolific author of bridge books, points out that there are only four ways of taking a trick by force, two of which are very easy:Nearly all trick-taking techniques in bridge can be reduced to one of these four methods.A combination of two such hands (i.e., 25 or 26 points shared between partners) is often sufficient for a partnership to bid, and generally to make, game in a major suit or notrump (more are usually needed for a minor suit game, as the level is higher).In natural systems, a 1NT opening bid usually reflects a hand that has a relatively balanced shape (usually between two and four (or less often five) cards in each suit) and a sharply limited number of high card points, usually somewhere between 12 and 18& xe2x80x93 the most common ranges use a span of exactly three points (for example, 12xe2x80x9314, 15xe2x80x9317 or 16xe2x80x9318), but some systems use a four-point range, usually 15xe2x80x9318.Opening bids of three or higher are preemptive bids, i.e., bids made with weak hands that especially favor a particular suit, opened at a high level in order to define the hand's value quickly and to frustrate the opposition.If the declaring side is vulnerable, a small slam is 750 points and a grand slam is 1,500.In rubber bridge, the rubber finishes when a partnership has won two games, but the partnership receiving the most overall points wins the rubber.Undertricks are scored in both variations as follows:The rules of the game are referred to as the laws as promulgated by various bridge organizations.The official rules of duplicate bridge are promulgated by the WBF as "The Laws of Duplicate Bridge 2017".Bridge is a game of skill played with randomly dealt cards, which makes it also a game of chance, or more exactly, a tactical game with inbuilt randomness, imperfect knowledge and restricted communication.Several systems include the use of opening bids or other early bids with weak hands including long (usually six to eight card) suits at the 2, 3 or even 4 or 5 levels as preempts.As a rule, a natural suit bid indicates a holding of at least four (or more, depending on the situation and the system) cards in that suit as an opening bid, or a lesser number when supporting partner; a natural NT bid indicates a balanced hand.Most systems use a count of high card points as the basic evaluation of the strength of a hand, refining this by reference to shape and distribution if appropriate.Thus in response to 4NT, a 'natural' bid of 5 would state a preference towards a diamond suit or a desire to play the contract in 5 diamonds, whereas if the partners have agreed to use the common Blackwood convention, a bid of 5 in the same situation would say nothing about the diamond suit, but tell the partner that the hand in question contains exactly one ace.Conventions are valuable in bridge because of the need to pass information beyond a simple like or dislike of a particular suit, and because the limited bidding space can be used more efficiently by adopting a conventional (artificial) meaning for a given call where a natural meaning would have less utility, because the information it would convey is not valuable or because the desire to convey that information would arise only rarely. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional Euclidean geometry: <blockquote>Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.<br />& & xe2x80x94Mandelbrot, in his introduction to The Fractal Geometry of Nature</blockquote>Mandelbrot has been called an artist, and a visionary His informal and passionate style of writing and his emphasis on visual and geometric intuition (supported by the inclusion of numerous illustrations) made The Fractal Geometry of Nature accessible to non-specialists.At Harvard, following the publication of his study of U.S. commodity markets in relation to cotton futures, he taught economics and applied sciences.Because of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovery of the Mandelbrot set in 1980. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A plaque was placed at the golf course in his memory.He is a member of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in the radio division.Calypso musician Roaring Lion wrote a tribute song in 1939 titled "Bing Crosby," in which he wrote: "Bing has a way of singing with his very heart and soul / Which captivates the world / His millions of listeners never fail to rejoice / At his golden voice& ..."Bing Crosby Stadium in Front Royal, Virginia, was named after Crosby in honor of his fundraising and cash contributions for its construction from 1948 to 1950.In 2006, the former Metropolitan Theater of Performing Arts ('The Met') in Spokane, Washington was renamed to The Bing Crosby Theater.On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Bing Crosby among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.Crosby wrote or co-wrote lyrics to 22 songs.(1932), written by Bing Crosby, Irving Bibo, and Paul McVey, featured in the 1932 Universal film The Cohens and Kellys in Hollywood# "I Would If I Could But I Can't" (1933), with Mitchell Parish and Alan Grey# "Where the Turf Meets the Surf" (1941) with Johnny Burke and James V. Monaco.# "Tenderfoot" (1953) with Bob Bowen and Perry Botkin, originally issued using the pseudonym of "Bill Brill" for Bing Crosby.# "Domenica" (1961) with Pietro Garinei / Gorni Kramer / Sandro Giovannini# "That's What Life is All About" (1975), with Ken Barnes, Peter Dacre, and Les Reed, US, AC chart, no.b'      DESCRIPTION: 20th-century American singer and actor.{ }Harry Lillis "Bing" Crosby Jr. (; May 3, 1903& xe2x80x93 October 14, 1977) The first multimedia star, Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1930 to 1954, he made over seventy feature films and recorded more than 1,600 different songs.His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed him, including Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Dick Haymes, Elvis Presley,Yank magazine said that he was "the person who had done the most for the morale of overseas servicemen" during World War II.On November 8, 1937, after Lux Radio Theatre's adaptation of She Loves Me Not, Joan Blondell asked Crosby how he got his nickname:Crosby: "Well, I'll tell you, back in the knee-britches day, when I was a wee little tyke, a mere broth of a lad, as we say in Spokane, I used to totter around the streets, with a gun on each hip, my favorite after school pastime was a game known as "Cops and Robbers", I didn't care which side I was on, when a cop or robber came into view, I would haul out my trusty six-shooters, made of wood, and loudly exclaim bing!At the end of the 20th century, TV Guide listed the Crosby-Bowie duet one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.Bing Crosby Productions, affiliated with Desilu Studios and later CBS Television Studios, produced a number of television series, including Crosby's own unsuccessful ABC sitcom The Bing Crosby Show in the 1964xe2x80x931965 season (with co-stars Beverly Garland and Frank McHugh). </my-abstract>

<title>List of Byzantine emperors</title>
<wiki-abstract> This is a list of the Byzantine emperors from the foundation of Constantinople in 330 AD, which marks the conventional start of the Byzantine Empire (or the Eastern Roman Empire), to its fall to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 AD. Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors (symbasileis) who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the various usurpers or rebels who claimed the imperial title. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The result was a completely different weather scenario.Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed.While the "butterfly effect" is often explained as being synonymous with sensitive dependence on initial conditions of the kind described by Lorenz in his 1963 paper (and previously observed by Poincarxc3xa9), the butterfly metaphor was originally appliedRecurrence, the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The initial trustees included Roger Bristow, Ted Enever, Peter Wescombe, Dr Peter Jarvis of the Bletchley Archaeological & Historical Society, and Tony Sale who in 1994 became the first director of the Bletchley Park Museums.Commander Alastair Denniston was operational head of GC&CS from 1919 to 1942, beginning with its formation from the Admiralty's Room 40 (NID25) and the War Office's MI1b.Denniston recognised, however, that the enemy's use of electromechanical cipher machines meant that formally trained mathematicians would also be needed;This eclectic staff of "Boffins and Debs" (scientists and debutantes, young women of high society)After initial training at the Inter-Service Special Intelligence School set up by John Tiltman (initially at an RAF depot in Buckingham and later in Bedfordwhere it was known locally as "the Spy School")Many of the women had backgrounds in languages, particularly French, German and Italian, among them were Rozanne Colchester a translator who worked mainly for the Italian air forces SectionProperly used, the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities that made Bletchley's attacks just barely feasible.While not changing the events, "Ultra" decrypts featured prominently in the story of Operation SALAM, Lxc3xa1szlxc3xb3 Almxc3xa1sy's mission across the desert behind Allied lines in 1942.Italian signals had been of interest since Italy's attack on Abyssinia in 1935.During the Spanish Civil War the Italian Navy used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard; this was solved by Knox in 1937.When Italy entered the war in 1940 an improved version of the machine was used, though little traffic was sent by it and there were "wholesale changes" in Italian codes and cyphers.Knox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations, which he staffed with women ("Dilly's girls"), who included Margaret Rock, Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and Mavis Lever.Mavis Lever solved the signals revealing the Italian Navy's operational plans before the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941, leading to a British victory.Although most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work, Admiral Cunningham visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them.On entering World War II in June 1940, the Italians were using book codes for most of their military messages.Their workshops cover introductions to codebreaking, cyber security and the story of Enigma and Lorenz.In October 2005, American billionaire Sidney Frank donated xc2xa3500,000 to Bletchley Park Trust to fund a new Science Centre dedicated to Alan Turing.In October 2011, the Bletchley Park Trust received a xc2xa34.6m Heritage Lottery Fund grant to be used "to complete the restoration of the site, and to tell its story to the highest modern standards" on the condition that xc2xa31.7m of 'match funding' is raised by the Bletchley Park Trust.The National Museum of Computing is housed in Block H, which is rented from the Bletchley Park Trust.He used his own money as the Government said they did not have the budget to do so.A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues (inspecting the site under the cover of "Captain Ridley's shooting party")"Station X" (X = Roman numeral ten), "London Signals Intelligence Centre", and "Government Communications Headquarters" were all cover names used during the war.The formal posting of the many "Wrens"members of the Women's Royal Naval Serviceworking there, was to HMS Pembroke V. Royal Air Force names of Bletchley Park and its outstations included RAF Eastcote, RAF Lime Grove and RAF Church Green.After the war, the Government Code & Cypher School became the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), moving to Eastcote in 1946 and to Cheltenham in the 1950s.In 1990 the site was at risk of being sold for housing development. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He is venerated in both the Anglican and Catholic Church, with a feast day of 25 May,Bede became known as Venerable Bede (Latin: ) by the 9th centuryBede's reputation as a historian, based mostly on the Historia Ecclesiastica, remains strong; Jarrow Hall xe2x80x93 Anglo-Saxon Farm, Village and Bede Museum (previously known as Bede's World), is a museum that celebrates the history of Bede and other parts of English heritage, on the site where he lived.Some manuscripts of the Life of Cuthbert, one of Bede's works, mention that Cuthbert's own priest was named Bede; it is possible that this priest is the other name listed in the Liber Vitae.At the age of seven, Bede was sent as a puer oblatusWhen Bede was about 17 years old, Adomnxc3xa1n, the abbot of Iona Abbey, visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow.In Bede's thirtieth year (about 702), he became a priest, with the ordination again performed by Bishop John.In about 701 Bede wrote his first works, the De Arte Metrica and De Schematibus et Tropis; both were intended for use in the classroom.In 708, some monks at Hexham accused Bede of having committed heresy in his work De Temporibus.In 733, Bede travelled to York to visit Ecgbert, who was then bishop of York.This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.Bede's account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the English Channel from Britain to Brittany described by Procopius, who was writing in the sixth century. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> A stylized embossed gold image of bubble tea was even suggested as an alternative cover for the country's passport.Bubble tea has become an icon for Chinese Americans in Los Angeles and is commonly known as simply "boba" in California.A bubble tea emoji has been accepted as part of the Unicode standard and will be issued in 2020.Bubble tea is used to represent Taiwan in the context of the Milk Tea Alliance.Known locally in Chinese as xe6xb3xa1xe6xb3xa1xe8x8cxb6 (Pinyin: pxc3xa0o pxc3xa0o chxc3xa1), bubble tea is loved by many in Singapore, exemplified by the laments of the public during COVID-19 when bubble tea shops had to close temporarily.In May 2013, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration issued an alert on the detection of maleic acid, an unapproved food additive, in some food products, including tapioca pearls.In May 2019, around 100 undigested tapioca pearls were found in the abdomen of a 14-year-old girl in Zhejiang province, China after she complained of constipation.In July 2019, Singapore's Mount Alvernia Hospital warned against the sugar content of bubble tea since the drink had become extremely popular in Singapore in recent years. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Allied commanders agreed that Marlborough would command 36,000 troops and attack Tallard's force of 33,000 on the left (including capturing the village of Blenheim), whilst Eugene, commanding 16,000 men would attack the Elector and Marsin's combined forces of 23,000 troops on the right wing; if this attack was pressed hard the Elector and Marsin would have no troops to send to aid Tallard on their right.]]Marshal Tallard, with 34,000 men, reached Ulm, joining with the Elector and Marsin in Augsburg on 5 August (although Tallard was not impressed to find that the Elector had dispersed his army in response to Marlborough's campaign of ravaging the region).With Eugene's forces at Hxc3xb6chstxc3xa4dt on the north bank of the Danube, and Marlborough's at Rain on the south bank, Tallard and the Elector debated their next move.Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water's edge, but it was apparent that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.Count Horn directed the Prince of Holstein-Beck to take the village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action.The army (assembled by the Duke's brother, General Charles Churchill) consisted of 66 squadrons, 31 battalions and 38 guns and mortars totalling 21,000 men (16,000 of whom were English troops).The military dangers in such an enterprise were numerous: Marlborough's lines of communication along the Rhine would be hopelessly exposed to French interference, for Louis' generals controlled the left bank of the river and its central reaches. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Battle of Ramillies was Villeroi's last command.Villeroi's right flank fell into chaos and was now open and vulnerable.As the French ranks wavered, the leading squadrons of Wxc3xbcrttemberg's Danish horse xe2x80x93 now unhampered by enemy fire from either village xe2x80x93 were also sent into the attack and fell upon the exposed flank of the Franco-Swiss infantry and dragoons.Field Marshal George Hamilton 1666xe2x80x931737 Earl of Orkney, by Martin MaingaudWhile the attack on Taviers went on the Earl of Orkney launched his first line of English across the Petite Gheete in a determined attack against the barricaded villages of Offus and Autre-Eglise on the Allied right.One account has it that the cannonball flew between the Captain-General's legs before hitting the unfortunate colonel, whose torso fell at Marlborough's feet xe2x80x93 a moment subsequently depicted in a lurid set of contemporary playing cards.Allied squadrons transferred from north to south gave the Allies a 5xe2x80x933 advantage on the plain where some 25,000 French and Allied cavalry were heavily engaged.The time was about 16:30, and the two armies were in close contact across the whole  front, from the skirmishing in the marshes in the south, through the vast cavalry battle on the open plain; to the fierce struggle for Ramillies at the centre, and to the north, where, around the cottages of Offus and Autre-Eglise, Orkney and de la Guiche faced each other across the Petite Gheete ready to renew hostilities.The arrival of the transferring squadrons now began to tip the balance in favour of the Allies."Vendxc3xb4me formally took over command in Flanders on 4 August; By the time Marlborough had closed down the Ramillies campaign he had denied the French most of the Spanish Netherlands west of the Meuse and north of the Sambre xe2x80x93 it was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English Duke but once again it was not decisive as these gains did not defeat France.The immediate question for the Allies was how to deal with the Spanish Netherlands, a subject on which the Austrians and the Dutch were diametrically opposed.Meanwhile, on the Upper Rhine, Villars had been forced onto the defensive as battalion after battalion had been sent north to bolster collapsing French forces in Flanders; there was now no possibility of his undertaking the re-capture of Landau.The total number of French casualties cannot be calculated precisely, so complete was the collapse of the Franco-Bavarian army that day. </my-abstract>

<title>Battleship</title>
<wiki-abstract> A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of large caliber guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet centered around the battleship was part of the command of the sea doctrine for several decades. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46& cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given a chance to show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.The last battleship confrontation in history was the Battle of Surigao Strait, on October 25, 1944, in which a numerically and technically superior American battleship group destroyed a lesser Japanese battleship group by gunfire after it had already been devastated by destroyer torpedo attacks.While a few battleships were repurposed as fire support ships and as platforms for guided missiles, few countries maintained battleships after World War II, with the last battleships being decommissioned at the end of the Cold War.The term battleship came into formal use in the late 1880s to describe a type of ironclad warship, now referred to by historians as pre-dreadnought battleships.Subsequent battleship designs, influenced by HMS Dreadnought, were referred to as "dreadnoughts", though the term eventually became obsolete as they became the only type of battleship in common use.Battleships were a symbol of naval dominance and national might, and for decades the battleship was a major factor in both diplomacy and military strategy.The Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships, though technical innovation in battleship design continued.In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist Giulio Douhet completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled The Command of the Air, which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.In the 1920s, General Billy Mitchell of the United States Army Air Corps, believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, testified in front of Congress that "1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship" and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds.Although Mitchell had required "war-time conditions", the ships sunk were obsolete, stationary, defenseless and had no damage control. </my-abstract>

<title>Battlecruiser</title>

<my-abstract> The additional cost could not be justified given the existing British lead and the new Liberal government's need for economy; the slower and cheaper , a relatively close copy of Dreadnought, was adopted instead.The next British battlecruisers were the three , slightly improved Invincibles built to fundamentally the same specification, partly due to political pressure to limit costs and partly due to the secrecy surrounding German battlecruiser construction, particularly about the heavy armour of .By 1911 Germany had built battlecruisers of her own, and the superiority of the British ships could no longer be assured.The result was a disaster for the Royal Navy's battlecruiser squadrons: Invincible, Queen Mary, and  exploded with the loss of all but a handful of their crews.The better-armoured German battlecruisers fared better, in part due to the poor performance of British fuzes (the British shells tended to explode or break up on impact with the German armour).In the years immediately after World War I, Britain, Japan and the US all began design work on a new generation of ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers.In the postxe2x80x93Cold War era, the Soviet  of large guided missile cruisers have also been termed "battlecruisers".The battlecruiser was developed by the Royal Navy in the first years of the 20th century as an evolution of the armoured cruiser.The first armoured cruisers had been built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical cruiser roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection.The Washington Naval Treaty, which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards, treated battleships and battlecruisers identically, and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped under the terms of the treaty.Improvements in armor design and propulsion created the 1930s "fast battleship" with the speed of a battlecruiser and armor of a battleship, making the battlecruiser in the traditional sense effectively an obsolete concept. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He went on to lead Labor to victory three more times, in 1984, 1987 and 1990, making him the most electorally successful and longest-serving Labor Leader in history.The Hawke Government created Medicare and Landcare, brokered the Prices and Incomes Accord, established APEC, floated the Australian dollar, deregulated the financial sector, introduced the Family Assistance Scheme, enacted the Sex Discrimination Act to prevent discrimination in the workplace, declared "Advance Australia Fair" as the country's national anthem, initiated superannuation pension schemes for all workers and oversaw passage of the Australia Act that removed all remaining jurisdiction by the United Kingdom from Australia.Hawke's brother Neil, who was seven years his senior, died at the age of seventeen after contracting meningitis, for which there was no cure at the time.His academic achievements were complemented by setting a new world record for beer drinking; he downed xe2x80x94equivalent to a yard of alexe2x80x94from a sconce pot in 11& seconds as part of a college penalty.The taxation system was also significantly reformed, with income tax rates reduced and the introduction of a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax; the latter two reforms were strongly opposed by the Liberal Party at the time, but were never reversed by them when they eventually returned to office in 1996.Although criticisms were levelled against the Hawke Government that it did not achieve all it said it would do on social policy, it nevertheless  enacting a series of reforms which remain in place to the present day.The Hawke Government also drew attention for a series of notable environmental decisions, particularly in its second and third terms. </my-abstract>

That same year, Pascal had a religious experience, and mostly gave up work in mathematics.In 1658, Pascal, while suffering from a toothache, began considering several problems concerning the cycloid.In time, xc3x89tienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouenxe2x80x94a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.In 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called Pascal's calculator or the Pascaline.Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.In De l'Art de persuader ("On the Art of Persuasion"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> One view, advanced in the 1950s and based on apparently unintelligible ogham inscriptions, was that the Picts may have also used a non-Indo-European language.The modern Brittonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed Brittonic, British, Common Brittonic, Old Brittonic or Proto-Brittonic, which is thought to have developed from Proto-Celtic or early Insular Celtic by the 6th century BC.Brittonic languages were probably spoken before the Roman invasion at least in the majority of Great Britain south of the rivers Forth and Clyde, though the Isle of Man later had a Goidelic language, Manx.The theory has been advanced (notably by T. F. O'Rahilly) that part of Ireland spoke a Brittonic language, usually termed Ivernic, before it was displaced by Primitive Irish, although the authors Dillon and Chadwick reject this theory as being implausible.During the period of the Roman occupation of what is now England and Wales (AD 43 to c. 410), Common Brittonic borrowed a large stock of Latin words, both for concepts unfamiliar in the pre-urban society of Celtic Britain such as urbanization and new tactics of warfare as well as for rather more mundane words which displaced native terms (most notably, the word for "fish" in all the Brittonic languages derives from the Latin piscis rather than the native *xc4x93skos - which may survive, however, in the Welsh name of the River Usk, ). </my-abstract>

<title>Binary prefix</title>
<wiki-abstract> A binary prefix is a unit prefix for multiples of units in data processing, data transmission, and digital information, notably the bit and the byte, to indicate multiplication by a power of 2. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The largest 8-inch diskette formats could contain more than a megabyte, and the capacities of those devices were often irregularly specified in megabytes, also without controversy.Older and smaller diskette formats were usually identified as an accurate number of (binary) KB, for example the Apple Disk II described as "140KB" had a 140xc3x971024-byte capacity, and the original "360KB" double sided, double density disk drive used on the IBM PC had a 360xc3x971024-byte capacity.In many cases diskette hardware was marketed based on unformatted capacity, and the overhead required to format sectors on the media would reduce the nominal capacity as well (and this overhead typically varied based on the size of the formatted sectors), leading to more irregularities.The capacities of most optical disc storage media like DVD, Blu-ray Disc, HD DVD and magneto-optical (MO) are given using SI decimal prefixes.A "4.7& GB" DVD has a nominal capacity of about 4.38& GiB.Tape drive and media manufacturers use SI decimal prefixes to identify capacity.Certain units are always used with SI decimal prefixes even in computing contexts.Two examples are hertz (Hz), which is used to measure the clock rates of electronic components, and bit/s, used to measure data transmission speed.Bus clock speeds and therefore bandwidths are both quoted using SI decimal prefixes.IEC prefixes are used by Toshiba, <blockquote>To help avoid inaccuracy (especially with the larger prefixes) and potential ambiguity, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2000 adopted a set of prefixes specifically for binary multipliers (See IEC 60027-2).However, , the IEEE Publications division does not require the use of IEC prefixes in its major magazines such as SpectrumThe International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), which maintains the International System of Units (SI), expressly prohibits the use of SI prefixes to denote binary multiples, and recommends the use of the IEC prefixes as an alternative since units of information are not included in SI.The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) prohibits the use of SI prefixes with anything but a power-of-1000 meaning, but does not recommend or otherwise cite the IEC binary prefixes.The European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) adopted the IEC-recommended binary prefixes via the harmonization document HD& 60027-2:2003-03.The European Union (EU) has required the use of the IEC binary prefixes since 2007.Most computer hardware uses SI prefixes to state capacity and define other performance parameters such as data rate.Main and cache memories are notable exceptions.Capacities of main memory and cache memory are usually expressed with customary binary prefixesOn the other hand, flash memory, like that found in solid state drives, mostly uses SI prefixes to state capacity.Some operating systems and other software continue to use the customary binary prefixes in displays of memory, disk storage capacity, and file size, but SI prefixes in other areas such as network communication speeds and processor speeds.In the following subsections, unless otherwise noted, examples are first given using the common prefixes used in each case, and then followed by interpretation using other notation where appropriate.Prior to the release of Macintosh System Software (1984), file sizes were typically reported by the operating system without any prefixes.)Wallace Givens responded with a proposal to use bK as an abbreviation for 1024 and bK2 or bK<sup>2</sup> for 1024<sup>2</sup>, though he noted that neither the Greek letter nor lowercase letter b would be easy to reproduce on computer printers of the day.Bruce Alan Martin of Brookhaven National Laboratory further proposed that the prefixes be abandoned altogether, and the letter B be used for base-2 exponents, similar to E in decimal scientific notation, to create shorthands like 3B20 for 3xc3x972<sup>20</sup>, a convention still used on some calculators to present binary floating point-numbers today.The set of binary prefixes that were eventually adopted, now referred to as the "IEC prefixes", The proposal was not accepted at the time.The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) began to collaborate with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to find acceptable names for binary prefixes.An operating system might map memory as 4096-byte pages, in which case exactly 8192 pages could be allocated within  bytes of memory: "8K" (8192) pages of "4 kilobytes" (4096 bytes) each within "32 megabytes" (32& MiB) of memory.All hard disk drive manufacturers state capacity using SI prefixes.USB flash drives, flash-based memory cards like CompactFlash or Secure Digital, and flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) use SI prefixes;for example, a "256 MB" flash card provides at least 256 million bytes (), not 256xc3x971024xc3x971024 ().The flash memory chips inside these devices contain considerably more than the quoted capacities, but much like a traditional hard drive, some space is reserved for internal functions of the flash drive.In 2008, the IEC prefixes were incorporated into the international standard system of units used alongside the International System of Quantities (see ISO/IEC 80000).Early computers used one of two addressing methods to access the system memory; binary (base 2) or decimal (base 10).For example, the IBM 701 (1952) used binary and could address 2048 words of 36 bits each, while the IBM 702 (1953) used decimal and could address ten thousand 7-bit words.By the mid-1960s, binary addressing had become the standard architecture in most computer designs, and main memory sizes were most commonly powers of two.When the High Density "1.44& MB" floppies came along, with 2880 of these 512-byte sectors, that terminology represented a hybrid binary-decimal definition of "1& MB" = 2<sup>10</sup> xc3x97 10<sup>3</sup> = 1&thinsp;024&thinsp;000 bytes.In contrast, hard disk drive manufacturers used megabytes or MB, meaning 10<sup>6</sup> bytes, to characterize their products as early as 1974.One of the earliest hard disk drives in personal computing history, the Seagate ST-412, was specified as Formatted: 10.0 Megabytes.The cylinder count of 306 is not conveniently close to any power of 1024; operating systems and programs using the customary binary prefixes show this as 9.5625& MB. </my-abstract>

a movable data pointer (initialized to point to the leftmost byte of the array); and two streams of bytes for input and output (most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively, and using the ASCII character encoding).The eight language commands each consist of a single character:(Alternatively, the <code>]</code> command may instead be translated as an unconditional jump to the corresponding <code>[</code> command, or vice versa; programs will behave the same but will run more slowly, due to unnecessary double searching.Nonetheless, like any Turing complete language, Brainfuck is theoretically capable of computing any computable function or simulating any other computational model, if given access to an unlimited amount of memory.Brainfuck is an example of a so-called Turing tarpit: It can be used to write any program, but it is not practical to do so, because Brainfuck provides so little abstraction that the programs get very long and/or complicated.As a first, simple example, the following code snippet will add the current cell's value to the next cell: Each time the loop is executed, the current cell is decremented, the data pointer moves to the right, that next cell is incremented, and the data pointer moves left again.In fact, using six symbols equivalent to the respective Brainfuck commands <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code><</code>, <code>></code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, Bxc3xb6hm provided an explicit program for each of the basic functions that together serve to compute any computable function. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In the Anglican Communion, the term applies to a bishop who is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop: the Bishop of Warwick is suffragan to the Bishop of Coventry (the diocesan), though both live in Coventry.; Area bishop: Some Anglican suffragans are given the responsibility for a geographical area within the diocese (for example, the Bishop of Stepney is an area bishop within the Diocese of London).; Titular bishop: A titular bishop is a bishop without a diocese.This development has muddied the waters somewhat as it could be argued that the strain of apostolic succession has been re-introduced into Anglicanism, at least within the Church of England.The Catholic Church does recognise as valid (though illicit) ordinations done by breakaway Catholic, Old Catholic or Oriental bishops, and groups descended from them; it also regards as both valid and licit those ordinations done by bishops of the Eastern churches, so long as those receiving the ordination conform to other canonical requirements (for example, is an adult male) and an eastern orthodox rite of episcopal ordination, expressing the proper functions and sacramental status of a bishop, is used; this has given rise to the phenomenon of episcopi vagantes (for example, clergy of the Independent Catholic groups which claim apostolic succession, though this claim is rejected by both Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy).The Eastern Orthodox Churches would not accept the validity of any ordinations performed by the Independent Catholic groups, as Eastern Orthodoxy considers to be spurious any consecration outside the Church as a whole.An auxiliary bishop is a titular bishop, and he is to be appointed as a vicar general or at least as an episcopal vicar of the diocese in which he serves.; Coadjutor bishop: A coadjutor bishop is an auxiliary bishop who is given almost equal authority in a diocese with the diocesan bishop, and the automatic right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop.This was the official stance of the English Church until the Commonwealth, during which time, the views of Presbyterians and Independents (Congregationalists) were more freely expressed and practiced.Bishops form the leadership in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Anglican Communion, the Lutheran Church, the Independent Catholic Churches, the Independent Anglican Churches, and certain other, smaller, denominations.The traditional role of a bishop is as pastor of a diocese (also called a bishopric, synod, eparchy or see), and so to serve as a "diocesan bishop," or "eparch" as it is called in many Eastern Christian churches.In the Ecumenical Patriarchate, bishops of modern dioceses are often given a titular see alongside their modern one (for example, the Archbishop of Thyateira and Great Britain).; Auxiliary bishop: An auxiliary bishop is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop (the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox equivalent of an Anglican suffragan bishop).&mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallesians 3:1.<br />"follow your bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the Father, and the presbytery as the Apostles; and to the deacons pay respect, as to God's commandment" &mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans 8:1.<br />"He that honoureth the bishop is honoured of God; he that doeth aught without the knowledge of the bishop rendereth service to the devil" &mdash; Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnans 9:1.As the Church continued to expand, new churches in important cities gained their own bishop. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Because of the immobilisation, people with fractures are often advised to undergo rehabilitation.There are several types of tumour that can affect bone; examples of benign bone tumours include osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteochondroma, osteoblastoma, enchondroma, giant cell tumour of bone, and aneurysmal bone cyst.Cancer can arise in bone tissue, and bones are also a common site for other cancers to spread (metastasise) to.Within any single bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns, known as cortical and cancellous bone, and each with different appearance and characteristics.The hard outer layer of bones is composed of cortical bone, which is also called compact bone as it is much denser than cancellous bone.Many bird bones have little marrow due to their being hollow.A bird's beak is primarily made of bone as projections of the mandibles which are covered in keratin.A deer's antlers are composed of bone which is an unusual example of bone being outside the skin of the animal once the velvet is shed.The extinct predatory fish Dunkleosteus had sharp edges of hard exposed bone along its jaws.Many animals possess an exoskeleton that is not made of bone.Every day, over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets, and 50xe2x80x93100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way.As well as creating cells, bone marrow is also one of the major sites where defective or aged red blood cells are destroyed.Determined by the species, age, and the type of bone, bone cells make up to 15 percent of the bone. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> We now give an outline of the proof for the special case in which f is a function from the standard n-simplex, <math>Delta^n,</math> to itself, whereFor every point <math>Pin Delta^n,</math> also <math>f(P)in Delta^n.</math> Hence the sum of their coordinates is equal:Hence, by the pigeonhole principle, for every <math>Pin Delta^n,</math> there must be an index <math>j in {0, ldots, n}</math> such that the <math>j</math>th coordinate of <math>P</math> is greater than or equal to the <math>j</math>th coordinate of its image under f:Moreover, if <math>P</math> lies on a k-dimensional sub-face of <math>Delta^n,</math> then by the same argument, the index <math>j</math> can be selected from among the  coordinates which are not zero on this sub-face.We now use this fact to construct a Sperner coloring.See fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces for a discussion of these theorems.There is also finite-dimensional generalization to a larger class of spaces: If <math>X</math> is a product of finitely many chainable continua, then every continuous function <math>f:Xrightarrow X</math> has a fixed point, where a chainable continuum is a (usually but in this case not necessarily metric) compact Hausdorff space of which every open cover has a finite open refinement <math>{U_1,ldots,U_m}</math>, such that <math>U_i cap U_j eq emptyset</math> if and only if <math>|i-j| leq 1</math>.The degree of <math>f</math> at a regular value <math>pin B(0)</math> is defined as the sum of the signs of the Jacobian determinant of <math>f</math> over the preimages of <math>p</math> under <math>f</math>:The degree is, roughly speaking, the number of "sheets" of the preimage f lying over a small open set around p, with sheets counted oppositely if they are oppositely oriented.As a special case, whenever x itself is on the boundary, then the intersection point F(x) must be x.Consequently, F is a special type of continuous function known as a retraction: every point of the codomain (in this case S<sup>n&minus;1</sup>) is a fixed point of F.Intuitively it seems unlikely that there could be a retraction of D<sup>n</sup> onto S<sup>n&minus;1</sup>, and in the case n = 1, the impossibility is more basic, because S<sup>0</sup> (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval D<sup>1</sup>) is not even connected.Hence, there must be a point <math>P</math> which satisfies the labeling condition in all coordinates: <math>f(P)_j leq P_j</math> for all <math>j.</math>Because the sum of the coordinates of <math>P</math> and <math>f(P)</math> must be equal, all these inequalities must actually be equalities. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b'      DESCRIPTION: Probability distribution of energy states of a system.In statistical mechanics and mathematics, a Boltzmann distribution (also called Gibbs distribution) is a probability distribution or probability measure that gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state's energy and the temperature of the system.The former gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state's energy; in contrast, the latter is used to describe particle speeds in idealized gases.The Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that gives the probability of a certain state as a function of that state's energy and  temperature of the system to which the distribution is applied. </my-abstract>

<title>Leg theory</title>
<wiki-abstract> Leg theory is a bowling tactic in the sport of cricket. The term leg theory is somewhat archaic and seldom used any longer, but the basic tactic remains a play in modern cricket. </wiki-abstract>

<headings> Fast leg theory , See also , References , </headings>

<lines> 13 </lines>
<my-abstract> Since a leg theory attack means the batsman is more likely to hit the ball on the leg side, additional fielders on that side of the field can be effective in preventing runs and taking catches.Stifling the batsman in this manner can lead to impatience and frustration, resulting in rash play by the batsman which in turn can lead to a quick dismissal.Leg theory can be a moderately successful tactic when used with both fast bowling and spin bowling, particularly leg spin to right-handed batsmen or off spin to left-handed batsmen. </my-abstract>

<title>Bouldering</title>
<wiki-abstract> Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. While bouldering can be done without any equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and to provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> This climb marked the beginning of a new generation of highball climbing that pushed not only height, but great difficulty.It is not unusual for climbers to rehearse such risky problems on top-rope, although this practice is not a settled issue.Groundbreaking ascents in this style include; Ambrosia, a 55-foot (16.8 meter) boulder in Bishop, California, climbed by Kevin Jorgeson in 2015 sporting the grade of V11.Too Big to Flail, V10, another 55 foot (16.8 meter) line in Bishop, California, climbed by Alex Honnold in 2016.Livin' Large, a 35-foot V15 in Rocklands, South Africa, found and established by Nalle Hukkataival in 2009, which has been repeated by only one person, Jimmy Webb.The Process is a 55-foot V16 in Bishop, California, first climbed by Daniel Woods in 2015.Traditionally, competition in bouldering was informal, with climbers working out problems near the limits of their abilities, then challenging their peers to repeat these accomplishments. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> Bock is a strong lager of German origin. Several substyles exist, including maibock (helles bock, heller bock), a paler, more hopped version generally made for consumption at spring festivals; doppelbock (double bock), a stronger and maltier version; and eisbock, a much stronger version made by partially freezing the beer and removing the ice that forms. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Schools may also own and operate their own buses for other transport needs, such as class field trips, or transport to associated sports, music, or other school events.Due to the costs involved in owning, operating, and driving buses and coaches, many bus and coach use a private hire of vehicles from charter bus companies, either for a day or two or a longer contract basis, where the charter company provides the vehicles and qualified drivers.Charter bus operators may be completely independent businesses, or charter hire may be a subsidiary business of a public transport operator that might maintain a separate fleet or use surplus buses, coaches, and dual-purpose coach-seated buses.Commuter transport operators may also use their coaches to conduct tours within the target city between the morning and evening commuter transport journey.Buses and coaches are also a common component of the wider package holiday industry, providing private airport transfers (in addition to general airport buses) and organised tours and day trips for holidaymakers on the package.Tour buses can also be hired as chartered buses by groups for sightseeing at popular holiday destinations.Much like old cars and trucks, buses often pass through a dealership where they can be bought privately or at auction.Bus operators often find it economical to convert retired buses to use as permanent training buses for driver training, rather than taking a regular service bus out of use. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> For example, the following constructions are common in colloquial Bulgarian:The phenomenon is practically obligatory in the spoken language in the case of inversion signalling information structure (in writing, clitic doubling may be skipped in such instances, with a somewhat bookish effect):Sometimes, the doubling signals syntactic relations, thus:This is contrasted with:In this case, clitic doubling can be a colloquial alternative of the more formal or bookish passive voice, which would be constructed as follows:Clitic doubling is also fully obligatory, both in the spoken and in the written norm, in clauses including several special expressions that use the short accusative and dative pronouns such as "" (I feel like playing), xd1x81xd1x82xd1x83xd0xb4xd0xb5xd0xbdxd0xbe xd0xbcxd0xb8 xd0xb5 (I am cold), and xd0xb1xd0xbexd0xbbxd0xb8 xd0xbcxd0xb5 xd1x80xd1x8axd0xbaxd0xb0xd1x82xd0xb0 (my arm hurts):Except the above examples, clitic doubling is considered inappropriate in a formal context.Questions in Bulgarian which do not use a question word (such as who?Examples:Another use of takova in colloquial speech is the word takovata, which can be used as a substitution for a noun, but also, if the speaker doesn't remember or is not sure how to say something, they might say takovata and then pause to think about it:Similar "meaningless" expressions are extremely common in spoken Bulgarian, especially when the speaker is finding it difficult to describe something.Most of the vocabulary  of modern Bulgarian consists of terms inherited from Proto-Slavic and local Bulgarian innovations and formations of those through the mediation of Old and Middle Bulgarian.'it wants') is used to for forming the (positive) future tense:The negative future is formed with the invariable construction   (see  below):The past tense of this verb xe2x80x93 xd1x89xd1x8fxd1x85  is conjugated to form the past conditional ('would have' xe2x80x93 again, with xd0xb4xd0xb0, since it is irrealis):The verbs   ('to have') and   ('to not have'):In Bulgarian, there are several conjunctions all translating into English as "but", which are all used in distinct situations.The major exception are vocative forms, which are still in use for masculine (with the endings -xd0xb5, -xd0xbe and -xd1x8e) and feminine nouns (-[xd1x8c/xd0xb9]xd0xbe and -xd0xb5) in the singular.In modern Bulgarian, definiteness is expressed by a definite article which is postfixed to the noun, much like in the Scandinavian languages or Romanian (indefinite: , 'person'; definite: , "the person") or to the first nominal constituent of definite noun phrases (indefinite: , 'a good person'; definite: , "the good person").The first mention of the language as the "Bulgarian language" instead of the "Slavonic language" comes in the work of the Greek clergy of the Archbishopric of Ohrid in the 11th century, for example in the Greek hagiography of Clement of Ohrid by Theophylact of Ohrid (late 11th century).During the Middle Bulgarian period, the language underwent dramatic changes, losing the Slavonic case system, but preserving the rich verb system (while the development was exactly the opposite in other Slavic languages) and developing a definite article.In addition to that, past compound forms using participles vary in gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and voice (active and passive) as well as aspect (perfective/aorist and imperfective).Bulgarian verbs express lexical aspect: perfective verbs signify the completion of the action of the verb and form past perfective (aorist) forms; imperfective ones are neutral with regard to it and form past imperfective forms. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The tetragonal bipyramid with identical edges, or regular octahedron, counts among the Platonic solids, while the triangular and pentagonal bipyramids with identical edges count among the Johnson solids (J).If the base is regular and the line through the apexes intersects the base at its center, the symmetry group of the n-gonal bipyramid has dihedral symmetry D as subgroups.The digonal faces of a spherical 2n-bipyramid represents the fundamental domains of dihedral symmetry in three dimensions: D, [n,2], (*n22), order 4n.}}A concave bipyramid has a concave interior polygon.The face-transitive regular bipyramids are the dual polyhedra of the uniform prisms and will generally have isosceles triangle faces.A bipyramid can be projected on a sphere or globe as n equally spaced lines of longitude going from pole to pole, and bisected by a line around the equator.Bipyramid faces, projected as spherical triangles, represent the fundamental domains in the dihedral symmetry D. Indeed, an n-tonal bipyramid can be seen as the Kleetope of the respective n-gonal dihedron.The volume of a bipyramid is V& =Bh where B is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b"      { }In British folklore, the Beast of Bodmin Moor, also known as the Beast of Bodmin cats of the same region came to be popularly known as the Beast of Bodmin Moor.In general, scientists reject such claims because of the improbably large numbers necessary to maintain a breeding population and because climate and food supply issues would make such purported creatures' survival in reported habitats unlikely.A long-held hypothesis suggests the possibility that alien big cats at large in the United Kingdom could have been imported as part of private collections or zoos, then later escaped or set free. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practiced in the Soviet Union.In 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural Reith LecturesIn the King's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the Order of Merit, Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply "That's right, just like your brother" immediately came to mind.In 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a CIA-funded anti-communist organisation committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the Cold War.In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy.Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of physics, ethics, and education to the layman.From 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and Cornwall, spending summers in Porthcurno.On a tour through the US in 1927, Russell met Barry Fox (later Barry Stevens), who became a well-known Gestalt therapist and writer in later years.Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell.Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry.Russell returned to the London School of Economics to lecture on the science of power in 1937.During the 1930s, Russell became a close friend and collaborator of V. K. Krishna Menon, then President of the India League, the foremost lobby in the United Kingdom for Indian self-rule.Before World War II, Russell taught at the University of Chicago, later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the UCLA Department of Philosophy.When Brand Blanshard asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, though he hastened to add "but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects".On ethics, Russell wrote that he was a utilitarian in his youth, yet he later distanced himself from this view.For the advancement of science and protection of the right to freedom of expression, Russell advocated The Will to Doubt, the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:Russell described himself in 1947 as an agnostic, saying: "Therefore, in regard to the Olympic gods, speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic.Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes.Russell argued for a "scientific society", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared.Russell was an active supporter of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, being one of the signatories of A. E. Dyson's 1958 letter to The Times calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.Like George Orwell, Russell was a champion of freedom of opinion and an opponent of both censorship and indoctrination. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Deliveries for the type totaled 104 aircraft with no unfilled orders remaining.The 767-300ER, the extended-range version of the , entered service with American Airlines in 1988. while the lower deck features two starboard-side cargo doors and one port-side cargo door.In June 2008, All Nippon Airways took delivery of the first 767-300BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter), a modified passenger-to-freighter model.The 767-400ER, the first Boeing wide-body jet resulting from two fuselage stretches, Power is provided by uprated General Electric CF6 engines.The FAA granted approval for the 767-400ER to operate 180-minute ETOPS flights before it entered service.A total of 37 767-400ERs were delivered to the variant's two airline customers, Continental Airlines (now merged with United Airlines) and Delta Air Lines, with no unfilled orders.In March 2000, Boeing was to launch the 259-seat 767-400ERX with an initial order for three from Kenya Airways with deliveries planned for 2004, as it was proposed to Lauda Air.Increased gross weight and a tailplane fuel tank would have boosted its range by , and GE could offer its  CF6-80C2/G2.Offered in July, the longer-range -400ERX would have a strengthened wing, fuselage and landing gear for a 15,000& lb (6.8 t) higher MTOW, up to 465,000& lb (210.92 t).Thrust would rise to  for better takeoff performance, with the Trent 600 or the General Electric/Pratt & Whitney Engine Alliance GP7172, also offered on the 747X.Range would increase by 525 nmi (950& km) to 6,150 nmi (11,390& km), with an additional fuel tank of 2,145 gallons (8,120 l) in the horizontal tail.The 767-400ERX would offer the capacity of the Airbus A330-200 with 3% lower fuel burn and costs.tIn July 2018, 742 aircraft were in airline service: 73 -200s, 632 -300 and 37 -400 with 65 -300F on order; the largest operators are Delta Air Lines (77), FedEx (60; largest cargo operator), UPS Airlines (59), United Airlines (), Japan Airlines (35), All Nippon Airways (34).The largest 767 customers by orders have been Delta Air Lines with 117, FedEx Express (130), All Nippon Airways (96), American Airlines (88), and United Airlines (82)., the Boeing 767 has been in 60 aviation occurrences,The airliner's first fatal crash, Lauda Air Flight 004, occurred near Bangkok on May 26, 1991, following the in-flight deployment of the left engine thrust reverser on a 767-300ER; none of the 223 aboard survived; as a result of this accident all 767 thrust reversers were deactivated until a redesign was implemented.On October 31, 1999, EgyptAir Flight 990, a 767-300ER, crashed off Nantucket, Massachusetts, in international waters killing all 217 people on board. On April 15, 2002, Air China Flight 129, a 767-200ER, crashed into a hill amid inclement weather while trying to land at Gimhae International Airport in Busan, South Korea.b'      DESCRIPTION: Wide-body twin-engine jet airliner family.{|{ }{ }The Boeing 767 is a wide-body airliner developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.The airliner was launched as the 7X7 project on July 14, 1978, the prototype first flew on September 26, 1981, and it was certified on July 30, 1982.The original 767-200 entered service on September 8 with United Airlines, and the extended-range 767-200ER in 1984.It was stretched into the  in October 1986, followed by the 767-300ER in 1988, the most popular variant.The 767-300F, a production freighter version, debuted in October 1995.It was stretched again into the 767-400ER from September 2000.To complement the larger 747, it has a seven-abreast cross-section, accommodating smaller LD2 ULD cargo containers.The 767 is Boeing's first wide-body twinjet, powered by General Electric CF6, Rolls-Royce RB211, or Pratt & Whitney JT9D turbofans.Boeing launched a freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995.In November 1995, after abandoning development of a smaller version of the 777, Boeing announced that it was revisiting studies for a larger 767. for its KC-X fleet renewal program.In December 2011, FedEx Express announced a 767-300F order for 27 aircraft to replace its DC-10 freighters, citing the USAF tanker order and Boeing's decision to continue production as contributing factors.With its successor, the Boeing New Midsize Airplane, that was planned for introduction in 2025 or later, and the 787 being much larger, Boeing could restart a passenger 767-300ER production to bridge the gap.In its first quarter of 2018 earnings report, Boeing plan to increase its production from 2.5 to 3 monthly beginning in January 2020 due to increased demand in the cargo market, as FedEx had 56 on order, UPS has four, and an unidentified customer has three on order.JT9D engines were eventually replaced by PW4000 engines.The aircraft has a conventional tail and a supercritical wing for reduced aerodynamic drag.Its two-crew glass cockpit, a first for a Boeing airliner, was developed jointly for the 757 xe2x88x92 a narrow-body aircraft, allowing a common pilot type rating.Studies for a higher-capacity 767 in 1986 led Boeing to develop the larger 777 twinjet, introduced in June 1995.The  767-200 typically seats 216 passengers over 3,900 nmi (7,200& km), while the 767-200ER seats 181 over a 6,590 nautical miles (12,200& km) range.The  767-300 typically seats 269 passengers over 3,900 nmi (7,200& km), while the 767-300ER seats 218 over 5,980 nmi (11,070& km).The 767-300F can haul  over 3,225 nmi (6,025& km), and the  767-400ER typically seats 245 passengers over 5,625 nmi (10,415& km).Military derivatives include the E-767 for surveillance, the KC-767 and KC-46 aerial tankers.and was targeted at overseas customers.In the mid-1980s, the 767 spearheaded the growth of twinjet flights across the northern Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines.Forecasting airline interest in larger-capacity models, Boeing announced the stretched  in 1983 and the extended-range 767-300ER in 1984. the type entered service with Japan Airlines on October 20, 1986.After the debut of the first stretched 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for greater capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the "Hunchback of Mukilteo" (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Braves, 10xe2x80x9327 when Ruth left, finished 38xe2x80x93115, at .248 the worst winning percentage in modern National League history.Of the 5 members in the inaugural class of Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936 (Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson and Ruth himself), only Ruth was not given an offer to manage a baseball team.Although Fuchs had given Ruth his unconditional release, no major league team expressed an interest in hiring him in any capacity.The end of the war in November set Ruth free to play baseball without such contrivances.During the 1919 season, Ruth was used as a pitcher in only 17 of his 130 gamesTwo home runs by Ruth on July 5, and one in each of two consecutive games a week later, raised his season total to 11, tying his career best from 1918.The older man became a mentor and role model to Ruth; biographer Robert W. Creamer commented on the closeness between the two:... which is remarkable, considering that Matthias was in charge of making boys behave and that Ruth was one of the great natural misbehavers of all time.... George Ruth caught Brother Matthias' attention early, and the calm, considerable attention the big man gave the young hellraiser from the waterfront struck a spark of response in the boy's soul... [that may have] blunted a few of the more savage teeth in the gross man whom I have heard at least a half-dozen of his baseball contemporaries describe with admiring awe and wonder as "an animal.Having just concluded a three-year contract at an annual salary of $70,000, Ruth promptly rejected both the Yankees' initial proposal of $70,000 for one year and their 'final' offer of two years at seventy-fivexe2x80x94the latter figure equalling the annual salary of then US President Herbert Hoover; instead, Ruth demanded at least $85,000 and three years.McCarthy was a disciplinarian, but chose not to interfere with Ruth, who did not seek conflict with the manager.The Yankees faced the Cubs, McCarthy's former team, in the 1932 World Series.Ruth remained productive in 1933.Ruth rests with his second wife, Claire, on a hillside in Section 25 at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.On April 19, 1949, the Yankees unveiled a granite monument in Ruth's honor in center field of Yankee Stadium.The Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum is located at 216 Emory Street, a Baltimore row house where Ruth was born, and three blocks west of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, where the AL's Baltimore Orioles play.Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position when he was not pitching, For the first time in his career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth was assigned a place in the batting order higher than ninth.Although Barrow predicted that Ruth would beg to return to pitching the first time he experienced a batting slump, that did not occur.Although Fairfax regretted that he could not have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.Also during the offseason, Ruppert had been sounding out the other clubs in hopes of finding one that would be willing to take Ruth as a manager and/or a player. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Barge and canal systems were nonetheless of great, perhaps even primary, economic importance until after the First World War in Europe, particularly in the more developed nations of the Low Countries, France, Germany and especially Great Britain which more or less made the system characteristically its own.Nowadays, custom built special purpose equipment called modular barges are extensively used in surveying, mapping, laying and burial of subsea optic fibre cables worldwide and other support services.File:Barge with cars.jpg|Self-propelled car barge on the River DanubeFile:Pxc3xa9niches sur le Canal du Midi.jpg|Barges near Toulouse, FranceFile:Andromeda (ship, 1958) Hannover Mittellandkanal 2006 by-RaBoe.jpg|Self-propelled barge Andromeda in canal at Hanover, GermanyFile:Messina_Karden_Bug.jpg|Tank barge on the River Moselle, GermanyFile:CrushedStoneBarge.jpg|Self-propelled barge carrying bulk crushed stoneFile:IjmuidenBarge.jpg|Self-propelled barge in the port of IJmuiden, NetherlandsFile:Pegasus_barge_being_moved_by_Freedom_Star_and_towboat_American_2.jpg|Barge carrying the Space Shuttle external tank for STS-119 under tow to Port Canaveral, Florida, United StatesFile:Yangzhou-Modern-Grand-Canal-boats-3351.JPG|Self-propelled barges on the Grand Canal of China near Yangzhou, Jiangsu, ChinaFile:CoalbargePittsburgh.JPG|Coal barges passing Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the Ohio RiverFile:Suphannahongsa-docked.jpg|Royal Barge Suphannahong docked at Wat Arun pier, one of the Thai royal barges featured in the royal barge ceremonyImage:Donna York.jpg|Towboat Donna York pushing barges of coal up the Ohio River at Louisville, Kentucky, United StatesFile:Ilya Repin - Barge Haulers on the Volga - Google Art Project.jpg|Barge Haulers on the Volga (1870xe2x80x9373), by Ilya RepinFile:Kapal tongkang.jpg|Tongkang or car barge, landed on Ketapang Port, Banyuwangi, IndonesiaFile:slipway at portland.JPG|Slipway at Portland Harbour, Dorset, England, holding a split dump barge (on right)File:Barge on Mosel by Kues (1).jpg|Barge on the river Mosel in Germany.File:Water_Barge_YW-59.jpg|US Navy Water Type B ship Barge, YW-59, launched August 29, 1941 File:YFN-958-Covered_Lighter_Barge-Non-Self-Propelled.jpg|YFN-958 a covered lighter barge, non-Self-propelled.Canal barges, towed by draft animals on a waterway adjacent towpath were of fundamental importance in the early Industrial Revolution, whose major early engineering projects were efforts to build viaducts, aqueducts and especially canals to fuel and feed raw materials to nascent factories in the early industrial takeoff (18th century) and take their goods to ports and cities for distribution.The barge and canal system contended favourably with the railways in the early Industrial Revolution before around the 1850s&ndash;1860s; for example, the Erie Canal in New York state is credited by economic historians with giving the growth boost needed for New York City to eclipse Philadelphia as America's largest port and city xe2x80x93 but such canal systems with their locks, need for maintenance and dredging, pumps and sanitary issues were eventually outcompeted in the carriage of high-value items by the railways due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of rail transport. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> swine (like the Germanic schwein) is the animal in the field bred by the occupied Anglo-Saxons and pork (like the French porc) is the animal at the table eaten by the occupying Normans.Dialects and accents vary amongst the four countries of the United Kingdom, as well as within the countries themselves.The major divisions are normally classified as English English (or English as spoken in England, which encompasses Southern English dialects, West Country dialects, East and West Midlands English dialects and Northern English dialects), Ulster English in Northern Ireland, Welsh English (not to be confused with the Welsh language), and Scottish English (not to be confused with the Scots language or Scottish Gaelic language).In the town of Corby,  north, one can find Corbyite, which unlike the Kettering accent, is largely influenced by the West Scottish accent.In addition, many British people can to some degree temporarily "swing" their accent towards a more neutral form of English at will, to reduce difficulty where very different accents are involved, or when speaking to foreigners.Phonological features characteristic of British English revolve around the pronunciation of the letter R, as well as the dental plosive T and some diphthongs specific to this dialect.In a number of forms of spoken British English, it is common for the phoneme  to be realised as a glottal stop  when it is in the intervocalic position, in a process called T-glottalisation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This created the requirement for unit rotation to prevent combat fatigue, with troops preferably not remaining in a combat area of operations for more than a month.The use of the term "battle" in military history has led to its misuse when referring to almost any scale of combat, notably by strategic forces involving hundreds of thousands of troops that may be engaged in either one battle at a time (Battle of Leipzig) or operations (Battle of Kursk).Occasionally both names for the same battle entered the popular culture, such as the First Battle of Bull Run and the Second Battle of Bull Run, which are also referred to as the First and Second Battles of Manassas.Sometimes in desert warfare, there is no nearby town name to use; map coordinates gave the name to the Battle of 73 Easting in the First Gulf War. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> ]]In 1995, potato plants producing CRY 3A Bt toxin were approved safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, making it the first human-modified pesticide-producing crop to be approved in the US, For current crops and their acreage under cultivation, see genetically modified crops.In 1996, genetically modified maize producing Bt Cry protein was approved, which killed the European corn borer and related species; subsequent Bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae.The Bt genes engineered into crops and approved for release include, singly and stacked: Cry1A.105, CryIAb, CryIF, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb1, Cry34Ab1, Cry35Ab1, mCry3A, and VIP, and the engineered crops include corn and cotton.Corn genetically modified to produce VIP was first approved in the US in 2010.In India, by 2014, more than seven million cotton farmers, occupying twenty-six million acres, had adopted Bt cotton.Monsanto developed a soybean expressing Cry1Ac and the glyphosate-resistance gene for the Brazilian market, which completed the Brazilian regulatory process in 2010.Ecological risk assessment aims to ensure there is no unintended impact on non-target organisms and no contamination of natural resources as a result of the use of a new substance, such as the use of Bt in genetically-modified crops.The silencing results in increased ingestion by C. elegans and is relieved inside the host, resulting in host death.Spores and crystalline insecticidal proteins produced by B. thuringiensis have been used to control insect pests since the 1920s and are often applied as liquid sprays.The Belgian company Plant Genetic Systems (now part of Bayer CropScience) was the first company (in 1985) to develop genetically modified crops (tobacco) with insect tolerance by expressing cry genes from B. thuringiensis; the resulting crops contain delta endotoxin. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Clinical trials reported in Clinical Otolaryngology show success in veterinary treatment of pet dogs with otitis.The SEPTIC bacterium sensing and identification method uses the ion emission and its dynamics during phage infection and offers high specificity and speed for detection.Phage display is a different use of phages involving a library of phages with a variable peptide linked to a surface protein.In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as prophage.Research in 2017 revealed that the bacteriophage xcexa63T makes a short viral protein that signals other bacteriophages to lie dormant instead of killing the host bacterium. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Cramp and Simmons (1980) listed the mean body mass overall of nominate buzzards in Europe overall as  in males and  in females.At one time, races of the common buzzard were thought to range as far in Asia as a breeding bird well into the Himalayas and as far east as northeastern China, Russia to the Sea of Okhotsk, and all the islands of the Kurile Islands and of Japan, despite both the Himalayan and eastern birds showing a natural gap in distribution from the next nearest breeding common buzzard.Conservative estimates put the total population at no fewer than 700,000 pairs in Europe, which are more than twice the total estimates for the next four birds of prey estimated as most common: the Eurasian sparrowhawk (more than 340,000 pairs), the common kestrel (more than 330,000 pairs) and the northern goshawk (more than 160,000 pairs).At least 238 common buzzards killed through persecution were recovered in England from 1975 to 1989, largely through poisoning.On the contrary, in southern Scotland, even though the buzzards were taking relatively large bird prey, largely red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica), 87% of birds taken were reportedly adults.Birds were the primary food for common buzzards in the Italian Alps, where they made up 46% of the diet against mammal which accounted for 29% in 146 prey items. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> At the time of the star's closest pass by the Sun, Barnard's Star will still be too dim to be seen with the naked eye, since its apparent magnitude will only have increased by one magnitude to about 8.5 by then, still being 2.5 magnitudes short of visibility to the naked eye.Barnard's Star has a mass of about 0.14 solar masses (),Barnard's Star has 10xe2x80x9332% of the solar metallicity.}}In November 2018 an international team of astronomers announced the detection of a candidate super-Earth orbiting in relatively close proximity to Barnard's Star.NASA's Space Interferometry Mission, which was to begin searching for extrasolar Earth-like planets, was reported to have chosen Barnard's Star as an early search target.The analysis of radial velocities that eventually led to discovery of the candidate super-Earth orbiting Barnard's Star was also used to set more precise upper mass limits for possible planets, up to and within the habitable zone: a maximum of  up to the inner edge and  on the outer edge of the optimistic habitable zone, corresponding to orbital periods of up to 10 and 40 days respectively. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In charts for constellations that did not exhaust the Greek letters, Bayer sometimes used the left-over Greek letters for miscellaneous labels as well.Ptolemy designated four stars as "border stars", each shared by two constellations: Alpheratz (in Andromeda and Pegasus), Elnath (in Taurus and Auriga), Nu Boxc3xb6tis (in Boxc3xb6tes and Hercules), and Fomalhaut (in Piscis Austrinus and Aquarius).Other cases of multiple Bayer designations arose when stars named by Bayer in one constellation were transferred by later astronomers to a different constellation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Bengt Lagerberg, drummer with The Cardigans, played bassoon on several tracks on the band's album Emmerdale.More recently, These New Puritans's 2010 album Hidden makes heavy use of the instrument throughout; their principal songwriter, Jack Barnett, claimed repeatedly to be "writing a lot of music for bassoon" in the run-up to its recording.The rock band Better Than Ezra took their name from a passage in Ernest Hemingway's A Moveable Feast in which the author comments that listening to an annoyingly talkative person is still "better than Ezra learning how to play the bassoon", referring to Ezra Pound.British psychedelic/progressive rock band Knifeworld features the bassoon playing of Chloe Herrington, who also plays for experimental chamber rock orchestra Chrome Hoof.In 2016, the bassoon was featured on the album Gang Signs and Prayers by UK xe2x80x9dgrimexe2x80x9d artist Stormzy.Lateef's diverse and eclectic instrumentation saw the bassoon as a natural addition (see, e.g., The Centaur and the Phoenix (1960) which features bassoon as part of a 6-man horn section, including a few solos) while Corea employed the bassoon in combination with flautist Hubert Laws.More recently, Illinois Jacquet, Ray Pizzi, Frank Tiberi, and Marshall Allen have both doubled on bassoon in addition to their saxophone performances.The bell <span style="color:red;">(6)</span>, extending upward; the bass joint (or long joint) <span style="color:red;">(5)</span>, connecting the bell and the boot; the boot (or butt) <span style="color:red;">(4)</span>, at the bottom of the instrument and folding over on itself; the wing joint (or tenor joint) <span style="color:red;">(3)</span>, which extends from boot to bocal; and the bocal (or crook) <span style="color:red;">(2)</span>, a crooked metal tube that attaches the wing joint to a reed <span style="color:red;">(1)</span> ().It is written so that the first bassoon does not play; instead, the player's role is to place an extension in the bell of the fourth bassoon so that the note can be played.The bassoon is infrequently used as a jazz instrument and rarely seen in a jazz ensemble. </my-abstract>

<title>Bipedalism</title>
<wiki-abstract> Bipedalism is a form of terrestrial locomotion where an organism moves by means of its two rear limbs or legs. An animal or machine that usually moves in a bipedal manner is known as a biped , meaning "two feet" (from the Latin bis for "double" and pes for "foot"). </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.A number of groups of extant mammals have independently evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion - for example humans, giant pangolins, the extinct giant ground sloths, numerous species of jumping rodents and macropods.In the Triassic period some groups of archosaurs (a group that includes crocodiles and dinosaurs) developed bipedalism; among the dinosaurs, all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the birds are members of a clade of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs, the theropods.A larger number of modern species intermittently or briefly use a bipedal gait.While upright, non-locomotory limbs become free for other uses, including manipulation (in primates and rodents), flight (in birds), digging (in giant pangolin), combat (in bears, great apes and the large monitor lizard) or camouflage (in certain species of octopus).The maximum bipedal speed appears less fast than the maximum speed of quadrupedal movement with a flexible backbone xe2x80x93 both the ostrich and the red kangaroo can reach speeds of , while the cheetah can exceed .Zoologists often label behaviors, including bipedalism, as "facultative" (i.e.Tree kangaroos are able to walk or hop, most commonly alternating feet when moving arboreally and hopping on both feet simultaneously when on the ground.There are no known living or fossil bipedal amphibians.Many species of lizards become bipedal during high-speed, sprint locomotion, including the world's fastest lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (genus Ctenosaura).The first known biped is the bolosaurid Eudibamus whose fossils date from 290 million years ago. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input.  In computer technology the term (usually shortened to booting) usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the operating system which will then take care of loading other software as needed. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Latvian appeared in a printed Catechism in 1585.One reason  for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples resisted Christianization longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence.With the establishment of a German state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct.After the Partitions of Commonwealth, most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the Russian Empire, where the native languages or alphabets were sometimes prohibited from being written down or used publicly in a Russification effort (see Lithuanian press ban for the ban in force from 1864 to 1904).The eventual expansion of the use of Slavic languages in the south and east, and Germanic languages in the west, reduced the geographic distribution of Baltic languages to a fraction of the area that they formerly covered. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment, gene finding, genome assembly, drug design, drug discovery, protein structure alignment, protein structure prediction, prediction of gene expression and proteinxe2x80x93protein interactions, genome-wide association studies, the modeling of evolution and cell division/mitosis.Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.Over the past few decades, rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology.The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuristics, fixed parameter and approximation algorithms for problems based on parsimony models to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian analysis of problems based on probabilistic models.Many of these studies are based on the detection of sequence homology to assign sequences to protein families.With the advent of next-generation sequencing we are obtaining enough sequence data to map the genes of complex diseases infertility, or Alzheimer's disease.In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways.Bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing DNA and protein sequences, aligning DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.Bioinformatics is a science field that is similar to but distinct from biological computation, while it is often considered synonymous to computational biology.Although biological networks can be constructed from a single type of molecule or entity (such as genes), network biology often attempts to integrate many different data types, such as proteins, small molecules, gene expression data, and others, which are all connected physically, functionally, or both.Systems biology involves the use of computer simulations of cellular subsystems (such as the networks of metabolites and enzymes that comprise metabolism, signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He is also the second-highest goalscorer for England, after his record of 49 goals which was held until 2015 was again surpassed by Rooney.He left Manchester United to become manager of Preston North End for the 1973xe2x80x9374 season.Charlton was born in Ashington, Northumberland, England on 11 October 1937 to coal miner Robert "Bob" Charlton (24 May 1909-April 1982) His elder brother, Jack, initially worked as a miner before applying to the police, only to also become a professional footballer with Leeds United.On 9 February 1953, then a Bedlington Grammar School pupil, Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by Manchester United chief scout Joe Armstrong.Charlton became one of the famed Busby Babes, the collection of talented footballers who emerged through the system at Old Trafford in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long-term plan of rebuilding the club after the Second World War.England won 4xe2x80x932 after extra time.Charlton's next England game was his 75th as England beat Northern Ireland; 2 caps later and he had become England's second most-capped player, behind the veteran Billy Wright, who was approaching his 100th appearance when Charlton was starting out and ended with 105 caps.Weeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against Sweden, breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by Jimmy Greaves.Chelsea won the match 1xe2x80x930.He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1969 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at The Sportsman's Club in central London.Charlton's emergence as the country's leading young football talent was completed when he was called up to join the England squad for a British Home Championship game against Scotland at Hampden Park on 19 April 1958, just over two months after he had survived the Munich air disaster.Charlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4xe2x80x930, with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger Tom Finney. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> "This "air of disappointment" factored into Kubrick's decision for his next film, an adaption of Stephen King's The Shining, a project that would not only please him artistically, but was more likely to succeed financially.In recent years, the film has gained a more positive reaction.Director Martin Scorsese has named Barry Lyndon as his favourite Kubrick film,In a list compiled by The Irish Times critics Tara Brady and Donald Clarke in 2020, Barry Lyndon was named the greatest Irish film of all time, despite its "Irish" provenance being questionable (it was made by a British production company and had an American director).As with any Stanley Kubrick film, there are a great deal of subtle messages and deeper meanings.The Countess bears Barry a son, Bryan Patrick, but the marriage is unhappy: Barry is openly unfaithful and enjoys spending his wife's money on self-indulgent luxuries, while keeping his wife in seclusion.Some years later, Barry's mother comes to live with him at the Lyndon estate.Other locations included Kells Priory (the English Redcoat encampment) Blenheim Palace, Castle Howard (exteriors of the Lyndon estate), Huntington Castle, Clonegal (exterior), Corsham Court (various interiors and the music room scene), Petworth House (chapel), Stourhead (lake and temple), Longleat, and Wilton House (interior and exterior) in England, Dunrobin Castle (exterior and garden as Spa) in Scotland, Dublin Castle in Ireland (the chevalier's home), Ludwigsburg Palace near Stuttgart and Frederick the Great's Neues Palais at Potsdam near Berlin (suggesting Berlin's main street Unter den Linden as construction in Potsdam had just begun in 1763). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of cellulose, fungi cell walls are made up of chitin and bacteria cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan.A gelatinous capsule is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall.Cell surface membranes also contain receptor proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as hormones.The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during endocytosis, the uptake of external materials by a cell, and cytokinesis, the separation of daughter cells after cell division; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility.Cells are able to be of the same genotype but of different cell type due to the differential expression of the genes they contain.Most distinct cell types arise from a single totipotent cell, called a zygote, that differentiates into hundreds of different cell types during the course of development. </my-abstract>

<title>Barter</title>
<wiki-abstract> In trade, barter (derived from baretor) is a system of exchange where participants in a transaction directly exchange goods or services for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money. Economists distinguish barter from gift economies in many ways; barter, for example, features immediate reciprocal exchange, not delayed in time. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> "Since direct barter does not require payment in money, it can be utilized when money is in short supply, when there is little information about the credit worthiness of trade partners, or when there is a lack of trust between those trading.Barter is an option to those who cannot afford to store their small supply of wealth in money, especially in hyperinflation situations where money devalues quickly.The limitations of barter are often explained in terms of its inefficiencies in facilitating exchange in comparison to money.It is said that barter is 'inefficient' because:;There needs to be a 'double coincidence of wants';There is no common measure of value;Indivisibility of certain goods;Lack of standards for deferred payments;Difficulty in storing wealthOther anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between "total" strangers, a form of barter known as "silent trade".Market actors use barter as a replacement for money as the method of exchange in times of monetary crisis, such as when currency becomes unstable (e.g., hyperinflation or a deflationary spiral) or simply unavailable for conducting commerce.No ethnographic studies have shown that any present or past society has used barter without any other medium of exchange or measurement, nor have anthropologists found evidence that money emerged from barter, instead finding that gift-giving (credit extended on a personal basis with an inter-personal balance maintained over the long term) was the most usual means of exchange of goods and services. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Barnard president Debora Spar said in 2012 that "the relationship is admittedly a complicated one, a unique one and one that may take a few sentences to explain to the outside community".Outside sources often describe Barnard as part of Columbia; The New York Times in 2013, for example, called Barnard "an undergraduate women's college of Columbia University".Columbia describes Barnard as an affiliated institutionSmith and Columbia president Seth Low worked to open Columbia classes to Barnard students.The board of trustees of Columbia repeatedly rejected Barnard's suggestion, The founding female trustees of Barnard College were Augusta Arnold (nxc3xa9e Foote), Helen Dawes Brown, Virginia Brownwell (nxc3xa9e Swinburne), Caroline Sterling Choate, Annie Nathan Meyer, Laura Rockefeller, Clara C. Stranahan (nxc3xa9e Harrison), Henrietta E.

<my-abstract> Generally the analogous opposite is true of the footwork and torso movement.There are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below.File:slip1.jpg|SlippingFile:slip2.jpg|BobbingFile:blocage1.jpg|Blocking (with the arms)File:protection passive1.jpg|Cover-Up (with the gloves)File:neutraliser1.jpg|ClinchingFile:pas de retrait.jpg|FootworkFile:retrait2.jpg|Pulling awayFile:contre_bolo1.jpg| Bolo punchFile:drop1.jpg| Overhand (overcut)In boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds for 1 minute and where his trainers stand.The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler, described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.The first boxing rules, called the Broughton's rules, were introduced by champion Jack Broughton in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in.Another unconventional punch is the rarely used bolo punch, in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm.An illegal punch to the back of the head or neck is known as a rabbit punch.Both the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, resulting in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand.Dr. Bill O'Neill, boxing spokesman for the British Medical Association, has supported the BMA's proposed ban on boxing: "It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, and we feel that we must have a total ban on boxing.b'      DESCRIPTION: Full contact combat sport}}{ }Boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international gamesxe2x80x94it also has its own World Championships. </my-abstract>

<headings> Etymology , History , Early history (1890s–1940s) , Golden Age (late 1940s–1960s) , Classic Bollywood (1970s–1980s) , New Bollywood (1990s–present) , Influences on Bollywood , Influence of Bollywood , India , Overseas , Genres , 
Bollywood employs people from throughout India. It attracts thousands of aspiring actors and actresses hoping for a break in the industry. Models and beauty contestants, television actors, stage actors and ordinary people come to Mumbai with the hope of becoming a star. As in Hollywood, very few succeed. Since many Bollywood films are shot abroad, many foreign extras are employed.
Very few non-Indian actors are able to make a mark in Bollywood, although many have tried. There have been exceptions, however, and the hit film Rang De Basanti starred the English Alice Patten. Kisna, Lagaan, and The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey also featured foreign actors, and Australian-born actress Emma Brown Garett has starred in a few Indian films.
Bollywood can be insular, and relatives of film-industry figures have an edge in obtaining coveted roles in films or being part of a film crew. However, industry connections are no guarantee of a long career: competition is fierce, and film-industry scions will falter if they do not succeed at the box office. Stars such as Dilip Kumar, Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, Anil Kapoor, Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai and Shah Rukh Khan lacked show-business connections.
 , 
Film scripts (known as dialogues in Indian English) and their song lyrics are often written by different people. Scripts are usually written in an unadorned Hindustani, which would be understood by the largest possible audience.
Some films have used regional dialects to evoke a village setting, or archaic Urdu in medieval historical films. In her book, The Cinematic ImagiNation, Jyotika Virdi wrote about the presence of Urdu in Hindi films: "Urdu is often used in film titles, screenplay, lyrics, the language of love, war, and martyrdom." Virdi notes that although Urdu was widely used in classic Hindi cinema decades after partition because it was widely taught in pre-partition India, its use has declined in modern Hindi cinema: "The extent of Urdu used in commercial Hindi cinema has not been stable ... the decline of Urdu is mirrored in Hindi films ... It is true that many Urdu words have survived and have become part of Hindi cinema's popular vocabulary. But that is as far as it goes ... For the most part, popular Hindi cinema has forsaken the florid Urdu that was part of its extravagance and retained a 'residual' Urdu".
Contemporary mainstream films also use English; according to the article "Bollywood Audiences Editorial", "English has begun to challenge the ideological work done by Urdu." Characters may shift from one language to the other to evoke a particular atmosphere (for example, English in a business setting and Hindi in an informal one). The blend of Hindi, Urdu and English sometimes heard in modern Bollywood films, known as Hinglish, has become increasingly common.
Cinematic language (in dialogues or lyrics) is often melodramatic, invoking God, family, mother, duty, and self-sacrifice. Song lyrics are often about love. Bollywood song lyrics (especially in older films) frequently use the poetic vocabulary of court Urdu, with a number of Persian loanwords. Another source for love lyrics in films such as Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje and Lagaan is the long Hindu tradition of poetry about the loves of Krishna, Radha, and the gopis.
Music directors often prefer working with certain lyricists, and the lyricist and composer may be seen as a team. This phenomenon has been compared to the pairs of American composers and songwriters who created classic Broadway musicals.
 , 
Sound in early Bollywood films was usually not recorded on location (sync sound). It was usually created (or re-created) in the studio, with the actors speaking their lines in the studio and sound effects added later; this created synchronisation problems. and several Bollywood films have recorded on-location sound since then.
 , 
In 1955, the Bollywood Cine Costume Make-Up Artist & Hair Dressers' Association (CCMAA) ruled that female makeup artists were barred from membership. The Supreme Court of India ruled in 2014 that the ban violated Indian constitutional guarantees under Article 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(g) (freedom to work) and Article 21 (right to liberty).
Bollywood film music is called filmi (from the Hindi "of films"). Bollywood songs were introduced with Ardeshir Irani's Alam Ara (1931) song, "De De Khuda Ke Naam pay pyaare". Bollywood songs are generally pre-recorded by professional playback singers, with the actors then lip syncing the words to the song on-screen (often while dancing). Although most actors are good dancers, few are also singers; a notable exception was Kishore Kumar, who starred in several major films during the 1950s while having a rewarding career as a playback singer. K. L. Saigal, Suraiyya, and Noor Jehan were known as singers and actors, and some actors in the last thirty years have sung one or more songs themselves.
Songs can make and break a film, determining whether it will be a flop or a hit: "Few films without successful musical tracks, and even fewer without any songs and dances, succeed".
Contemporary Bollywood dancers include Madhuri Dixit, Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Sridevi, Meenakshi Seshadri, Malaika Arora Khan, Shahid Kapoor, Katrina Kaif and Tiger Shroff.
Bollywood producers have been releasing a film's soundtrack (as tapes or CDs) before the film's release, hoping that the music will attract audiences; a soundtrack is often more popular than its film. Some producers also release music videos, usually (but not always) with a song from the film.
 , 
Bollywood films are multi-million dollar productions, with the most expensive productions costing up to  1 billion (about US$20& million). The science-fiction film Ra.One was made on a budget of  1.35 billion (about $27 million), making it the most expensive Bollywood film of all time.
Another problem facing Bollywood is widespread copyright infringement of its films. Often, bootleg DVD copies of movies are available before they are released in cinemas. Manufacturing of bootleg DVD, VCD, and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is an established small-scale industry in parts of south and southeast Asia. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) estimates that the Bollywood industry loses $100 million annually from unlicensed home videos and DVDs. In addition to the homegrown market, demand for these copies is large amongst portions of the Indian diaspora. Bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies, since the Pakistani government has banned their sale, distribution and telecast. Films are frequently broadcast without compensation by small cable-TV companies in India and other parts of South Asia. Small convenience stores, run by members of the Indian diaspora in the US and the UK, regularly stock tapes and DVDs of dubious provenance; consumer copying adds to the problem. The availability of illegal copies of movies on the Internet also contributes to industry losses.
Satellite TV, television and imported foreign films are making inroads into the domestic Indian entertainment market. In the past, most Bollywood films could make money; now, fewer do. Most Bollywood producers make money, however, recouping their investments from many sources of revenue (including the sale of ancillary rights). There are increasing returns from theatres in Western countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, where Bollywood is slowly being noticed. As more Indians migrate to these countries, they form a growing market for upscale Indian films. In 2002, Bollywood sold 3.6 billion tickets and had a total revenue (including theatre tickets, DVDs and television) of $1.3 billion; Hollywood films sold 2.6 billion tickets, and had a total revenue of $51 billion.
 , 
A number of Indian artists hand-painted movie billboards and posters. M. F. Husain painted film posters early in his career; human labour was found to be cheaper than printing and distributing publicity material. Bollywood is also used to advertise other products. Product placement, used in Hollywood, is also common in Bollywood.
 , 
The Filmfare Awards are some of the most prominent awards given to Hindi films in India.
The National Film Awards were also introduced in 1954. The Indian government has sponsored the awards, given by its Directorate of Film Festivals (DFF), since 1973. The DFF screens Bollywood films, films from the other regional movie industries, and independent/art films. The awards are made at an annual ceremony presided over by the president of India. Unlike the Filmfare Awards, which are chosen by the public and a committee of experts, the National Film Awards are decided by a government panel.
Other awards ceremonies for Hindi films in India are the Screen Awards (begun in 1995) and the Stardust Awards, which began in 2003. The International Indian Film Academy Awards (begun in 2000) and the Zee Cine Awards, begun in 1998, are held abroad in a different country each year.
 , 
In addition to their popularity among the Indian diaspora from Nigeria and Senegal to Egypt and Russia, generations of non-Indians have grown up with Bollywood. and China.
Bollywood entered the consciousness of Western audiences and producers during the late 20th century,
 , 
 , 
Bollywood films are also popular in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal, where Hindustani is widely understood. Many Pakistanis understand Hindi, due to its linguistic similarity to Urdu. Bollywood films in Nepal earn more than Nepali films, and Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar and Shah Rukh Khan are popular in the country.
 
The films are also popular in Afghanistan due to its proximity to the Indian subcontinent and their cultural similarities, particularly in music. Popular actors include Shah Rukh Khan, Ajay Devgan, Sunny Deol, Aishwarya Rai, Preity Zinta, and Madhuri Dixit.
 , 
Bollywood films are popular in Southeast Asia, particularly in maritime Southeast Asia. The three Khans are very popular in the Malay world, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. The films are also fairly popular in Thailand.
India has cultural ties with Indonesia, and Bollywood films were introduced to the country at the end of World War II in 1945. The "angry young man" films of Amitabh Bachchan and Salim–Javed were popular during the 1970s and 1980s before Bollywood's popularity began gradually declining in the 1980s and 1990s. It experienced an Indonesian revival with the release of Shah Rukh Khan's Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) in 2001, which was a bigger box-office success in the country than Titanic (1997). Bollywood has had a strong presence in Indonesia since then, particularly Shah Rukh Khan films such as Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho, Chalte Chalte and Koi...& Mil Gaya (all 2003), and Veer-Zaara (2004).

Some Bollywood films have been widely appreciated in China, Japan, and South Korea. Several Hindi films have been commercially successful in Japan, including Mehboob Khan's Aan (1952, starring Dilip Kumar) and Aziz Mirza's Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992, starring Shah Rukh Khan). The latter sparked a two-year boom in Indian films after its 1997 release,
Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani, Awaara, and Do Bigha Zamin were successful in China during the 1940s and 1950s, and remain popular with their original audience. Few Indian films were commercially successful in the country during the 1970s and 1980s, among them Tahir Hussain's Caravan, Noorie and Disco Dancer.
When 3 Idiots was released in China, China was the world's 15th-largest film market (partly due to its widespread pirate DVD distribution at the time). The pirate market introduced the film to Chinese audiences, however, and it became a cult hit. According to the Douban film-review site, 3 Idiots is China's 12th-most-popular film of all time; only one domestic Chinese film (Farewell My Concubine) ranks higher, and Aamir Khan acquired a large Chinese fan base as a result.

Although Bollywood is less successful on some Pacific islands such as New Guinea, it ranks second to Hollywood in Fiji (with its large Indian minority), Australia and New Zealand.

Bollywood films are popular in the former Soviet Union (Russia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia),
According to diplomat Ashok Sharma, who served in the Commonwealth of Independent States,
Bollywood has experienced revenue growth in Canada and the United States, particularly in the South Asian communities of large cities such as Toronto, Chicago, and New York City. Since the mid-1990s, a number of Indian films have been largely (or entirely) shot in New York, Los Angeles, Vancouver or Toronto. Films such as The Guru (2002) and Marigold: An Adventure in India (2007) attempted to popularise Bollywood for Hollywood.
 , 
Pressured by rushed production schedules and small budgets, some Bollywood writers and musicians have been known to plagiarise. Ideas, plot lines, tunes or riffs have been copied from other Indian film industries or foreign films (including Hollywood and other Asian films) without acknowledging the source.
Before the 1990s, plagiarism occurred with impunity. Copyright enforcement was lax in India, and few actors or directors saw an official contract. The Hindi film industry was not widely known to non-Indian audiences (except in the Soviet states), who would be unaware that their material had been copied. Audiences may not have been aware of plagiarism, since many in India were unfamiliar with foreign films and music.
A commonly-reported justification for plagiarism in Bollywood is that cautious producers want to remake popular Hollywood films in an Indian context. Although screenwriters generally produce original scripts, many are rejected due to uncertainty about whether a film will be successful. Some filmmakers see plagiarism in Bollywood as an integral part of globalisation, with which Western (particularly American) culture is embedding itself into Indian culture.
Although very few cases of film-copyright violations have been taken to court because of a slow legal process,
 , 
The Pakistani Qawwali musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan had a big impact on Bollywood music, inspiring numerous Indian musicians working in Bollywood, especially during the 1990s. However, there were many instances of Indian music directors plagiarising Khan's music to produce hit filmi songs. One of the Bollywood music directors who frequently plagiarised him, Anu Malik, claimed that he loved Khan's music and was actually showing admiration by using his tunes.
Bollywood soundtracks also plagiarised Guinean singer Mory Kanté, particularly his 1987 album Akwaba Beach. His song, "Tama", inspired two Bollywood songs: Bappi Lahiri's "Tamma Tamma" in Thanedaar (1990) and "Jumma Chumma" in Laxmikant–Pyarelal's soundtrack for Hum (1991). The latter also featured "Ek Doosre Se", which copied Kanté's "Inch Allah". His song "Yé ké yé ké" was used as background music in the 1990 Bollywood film Agneepath, inspired the Bollywood song "Tamma Tamma" in Thanedaar.

<my-abstract> Films based on "Persianate adventure-romances" led to a popular genre of "Arabian Nights cinema".Scholars Chaudhuri Diptakirti and Rachel Dwyer and screenwriter Javed Akhtar identify Urdu literature as a major influence on Hindi cinema.Todd Stadtman identifies several foreign influences on 1970s commercial Bollywood masala films, including New Hollywood, Italian exploitation films, and Hong Kong martial arts cinema.Perhaps Bollywood's greatest influence has been on India's national identity, where (with the rest of Indian cinema) it has become part of the "Indian story".Bollywood has also had a socio-political impact on Indian society, reflecting Indian politics.At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were cinematic staples.Before the 1947 partition of India, which divided the country into the Republic of India and Pakistan, the Bombay film industry (now called Bollywood) was closely linked to the Lahore film industry (now the Lollywood industry of Pakistani cinema); both produced films in Hindustani, the lingua franca of northern and central India.Many actors, filmmakers and musicians from the Lahore industry migrated to the Bombay industry during the 1940s, including actors K. L. Saigal, Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Dev Anand; playback singers Mohammed Rafi, Noorjahan, and Shamshad Begum.Masala films generally fall under the musical film genre, of which Indian cinema has been the largest producer since the 1960s when it exceeded the American film industry's total musical output after musical films declined in the West; the first Indian musical talkie was Alam Ara (1931), several years after the first Hollywood musical talkie The Jazz Singer (1927). </my-abstract>

<title>Bowls</title>
<wiki-abstract> Bowls, or lawn bowls, is a sport in which the objective is to roll biased balls so that they stop close to a smaller ball called a  "jack" or "kitty". It is played on a bowling green, which may be flat (for "flat-green bowls") or convex or uneven (for "crown green bowls"). </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> After each competitor has delivered all of their bowls (four each in singles and pairs, three each in triples, and two bowls each in fours), the distance of the closest bowls to the jack is determined (the jack may have been displaced) and points, called "shots", are awarded for each bowl which a competitor has closer than the opponent's nearest to the jack.In the first end of the game the A players lead off with 2 bowls each, then the B players play 4 bowls each, before the A players complete the end with their final 2 bowls. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Burgundian kingdom was made part of the Merovingian kingdoms, and the Burgundians themselves were by and large absorbed as well.The 5th century Gallo-Roman poet and landowner Sidonius, who at one point lived with the Burgundians, described them as a long-haired people of immense physical size:</ref>}}{ }The Burgundians and their language were described as Germanic by the poet Sidonius Apollinaris.More specifically their language is thought to have belonged to the East Germanic language group, based upon their presumed equivalence to the Burgundians named much earlier by Pliny in the east, and some names and placenames.The name of this kingdom survives in the regional appellation, Burgundy, which is a region in modern France, representing only a part of that kingdom.Another part of the Burgundians stayed in their previous homeland in the Oder-Vistula basin and formed a contingent in Attila's Hunnic army by 451.Before clear documentary evidence begins, the Burgundians may have originally emigrated from mainland Scandinavia to the Baltic island of Bornholm, and from there to the Vistula basin, in the middle of what is now Poland.The ethnonym Burgundians is commonly used in English to refer to the Burgundi (Burgundionei, Burgundiones or Burgunds) who settled in Sapaudia (Savoy), in the western Alps, during the 5th century.Moreover, Gundobad's son and successor, Sigismund, was himself a Catholic, and there is evidence that many of the Burgundian people had converted by this time as well, including several female members of the ruling family.The Burgundians left three legal codes, among the earliest from any of the Germanic tribes.The Liber Constitutionum sive Lex Gundobada ("The Book of Constitutions or Law of Gundobad"), also known as the Lex Burgundionum, or more simply the Lex Gundobada or the Liber, was issued in several parts between 483 and 516, principally by Gundobad, but also by his son, Sigismund. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The battle earned him one of his two Hero of the Soviet Union awards.During the defence of Stalingrad, the Red Army deployed five armies in and around the city (28th, 51st, 57th, 62nd and 64th Armies); and an additional nine armies in the encirclement counteroffensive (24th, 65th, 66th Armies and 16th Air Army from the north as part of the Don Front offensive, and 1st Guards Army, 5th Tank, 21st Army, 2nd Air Army and 17th Air Army from the south as part of the Southwestern Front).David Glantz indicatedThe Soviets had enough warning of the German advance to ship grain, cattle, and railway cars across the Volga out of harm's way, but Stalin refused to evacuate the 400,000 civilian residents trapped in Stalingrad.Paulus refused, concerned about the Red Army attacks on the flank of Army Group Don and Army Group B in their advance on Rostov-on-Don, "an early abandonment" of Stalingrad "would result in the destruction of Army Group A in the Caucasus", and the fact that his 6th Army tanks only had fuel for a 30& km advance towards Hoth's spearhead, a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of resupply by air.The 4th Panzer Army, ordered south on 13 July to block the Soviet retreat "weakened by the 17th Army and the 1st Panzer Army", had turned northwards to help take the city from the south.To the south, Army Group A was pushing far into the Caucasus, but their advance slowed as supply lines grew overextended.The wings of the 6th Army and the 4th Panzer Army met near Jablotchni along the Zaritza on 2 Sept. By 1 September, the Soviets could only reinforce and supply their forces in Stalingrad by perilous crossings of the Volga under constant bombardment by artillery and aircraft.On 5 September, the Soviet 24th and 66th Armies organized a massive attack against XIV Panzer Corps.The British historian Antony Beevor noted the "sinister" message from the Stalingrad Front's Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: "The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower" as an example of the sort of coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (later to be renamed SMERSH).Many women fought on the Soviet side, or were under fire.The attacking Soviet units under the command of Gen. Nikolay Vatutin consisted of three complete armies, the 1st Guards Army, 5th Tank Army and 21st Army, including a total of 18 infantry divisions, eight tank brigades, two motorised brigades, six cavalry divisions and one anti-tank brigade. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This is consistent with the Southeast Asian traditions which also describe Bodhidharma as a former South Indian Tamil prince who had awakened his kundalini and renounced royal life to become a monk.Several stories about Bodhidharma have become popular legends, which are still being used in the Ch'an, Seon and Zen-tradition.The Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall says that in 527, Bodhidharma visited Emperor Wu of Liang, a fervent patron of Buddhism:This encounter was included as the first kxc5x8dan of the Blue Cliff Record.Failing to make a favorable impression in South China, Bodhidharma is said to have travelled to the Shaolin Monastery.The idea of a line of descent from xc5x9axc4x81kyamuni Buddha is the basis for the distinctive lineage tradition of Chan Buddhism.According to the Song of Enlightenment (xe8xadx89xe9x81x93xe6xadx8c Zhxc3xa8ngdxc3xa0o gxc4x93) by Yongjia Xuanjue, one of the chief disciples of Huxc3xacnxc3xa9ng, was Bodhidharma, the 28th Patriarch of Buddhism in a line of descent from Gautama Buddha via his disciple Mahxc4x81kxc4x81xc5x9byapa:Twenty-eight Fathers followed him in the West;The Lamp was then brought over the sea to this country;And Bodhidharma became the First Father hereHis mantle, as we all know, passed over six Fathers,And by them many minds came to see the Light.</poem>The Transmission of the Light gives 28 patriarchs in this transmission:Bodhidharma has been the subject of critical scientific research, which has shed new light on the traditional stories about Bodhidharma.According to John McRae, Bodhidharma has been the subject of a hagiographic process which served the needs of Chan Buddhism.According to him it is not possible to write an accurate biography of Bodhidharma:}}McRae's standpoint accords with Yanagida's standpoint: "Yanagida ascribes great historical value to the witness of the disciple Tanlin, but at the same time acknowledges the presence of "many puzzles in the biography of Bodhidharma".His name means "dharma of awakening (bodhi)" in Sanskrit.Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend and unreliable details.According to the principal Chinese sources, Bodhidharma came from the Western Regions, which refers to Central Asia but may also include the Indian subcontinent, and was either a "Persian Central Asian" or a "South Indian [...] the third son of a great Indian king."}}Jingde Records of the Transmission of the Lamp (xe6x99xafxe5xbexb7xe4xbcxa0xe7x81xafxe5xbdx95) of Daoyuan, presented to the emperor in 1004, records that Bodhidharma wished to return to India and called together his disciples: Heng-Ching Shih states that according to the Jxc7x90ngdxc3xa9 chuxc3xa1ndxc4x93ng lxc3xb9 xe6x99xafxe5xbexb7xe4xbcxa0xe7x81xafxe5xbdx95 the first `bhikxe1xb9xa3uni` mentioned in the Chxc3xa1n literature was a disciple of the First Chan Patriarch, Bodhidharma, known as Zxc5x8dngzhxc7x90 xe5xaex97xe6x97xa8 [early-mid 6th century]}} stepped up and said, "It is like a glorious glimpse of the realm of Akshobhya Buddha.Daoxuan, for example, in a late recension of his biography of Bodhidharma's successor Huike, has the sxc5xabtra as a basic and important element of the teachings passed down by Bodhidharma:}}Another early text, the "Record of the Masters and Disciples of the Laxe1xb9x85kxc4x81vatxc4x81ra Sxc5xabtra" () of Jingjue (xe6xb7xa8xe8xa6xba; 683xe2x80x93750), also mentions Bodhidharma in relation to this text. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The team is owned by Steve Bisciotti and valued at $2.59 billion, making the Ravens the 29th-most valuable sports franchise in the world.The name "Ravens" was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's poem The Raven.Before the football team, there was the Baltimore Ravens wheelchair basketball team xe2x80x94 the original Baltimore Ravens.In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore, where such personnel would then form an expansion team.The Ravens have been one of the more successful franchises since their inception; the team has qualified for the NFL playoffs 12 times since 2000 with two Super Bowl championship titles (Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLVII), two AFC Championship titles (2000 and 2012), four AFC Championship game appearances (2000, 2008, 2011 and 2012) six AFC North division titles (2003, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2018, and 2019) and 15 playoff victories.The Ravens were 8xe2x80x936, with the 6th seed, but after losing their next two games, and the San Diego Chargers winning their next two to clinch the 6th seed, the Ravens finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007.On January 27, 2014, the Ravens hired former Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak to be their new offensive coordinator after Jim Caldwell accepted the new available head coaching job with the Detroit Lions.They held opposing teams to 165 total points, surpassing the 1985 Chicago Bears mark of 198 points for a 16-game season as well as surpassing the 1986 Chicago Bears mark of 187 points for a 16-game season, which at that time was the current NFL record these things along with outstanding play by the defense places the 2000 Ravens in the discussion as one of the Greatest if not the Greatest NFL defense of All Time along with the 1985 Chicago Bears, 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the 2015 Denver Broncos defenses.Since the divisional rival Tennessee Titans had a record of 13xe2x80x933, the Ravens had to play in the wild card round.However, the Ravens lost their next 3 games, losing to the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers in last-minute field goals and were shut out in an attempt to tie the game against the Cleveland Browns 24xe2x80x9318.After winning and losing their next game, the Ravens came out 4xe2x80x936, but managed winning their next four games in dominating the Jets 19xe2x80x933, a Steelers win 22-20 during Thanksgiving, a booming ending in Baltimore against the Vikings 29xe2x80x9326, and an 18xe2x80x9316 win at Detroit, including Justin Tucker's 61-yard game-winning field goal.This led to public outrage and The Baltimore Sun describing Tagliabue as having an "Anybody But Baltimore" policy.By May 1994, Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos had gathered a new group of investors, including author Tom Clancy, to bid on teams whose owners had expressed interest in relocating.Having failed to obtain a franchise via the expansion, the city, despite having "misgivings," turned to the possibility of obtaining the Cleveland Browns, whose owner Art Modell was financially struggling and at odds with the city of Cleveland over needed improvements to the team's stadium.Enticed by Baltimore's available funds for a first-class stadium and a promised yearly operating subsidy of $25 million, Modell announced on November 6, 1995 his intention to relocate the team from Cleveland to Baltimore the following year. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The archaeologists were able to identify at least 30 tombs.Archaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as a city in the Kingdom of Judah was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the City of David in the form of a bulla (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads "From the town of Bethlehem to the King," indicating that it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.Writing in the 4th century, the Pilgrim of Bordeaux reported that the sepulchers of David, Ezekiel, Asaph, Job, Jesse, and Solomon were located near Bethlehem.Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city.On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem, Land seizures for Israeli settlements have also prevented construction of a new hospital for the inhabitants of Bethlehem, as well as the barrier separating dozens of Palestinian families from their farmland and Christian communities from their places of worship.Bethlehem is located at an elevation of about  above sea level,  higher than nearby Jerusalem.In the center of Bethlehem is its old city.The Badd Giacaman Museum, located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of olive oil production.Bethlehem is the muhfaza (seat) or district capital of the Bethlehem Governorate.Bethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the mukhtars ("heads") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town.b'      { }Bethlehem (;  |help=no}}, "House of Meat";  , , "House of Bread";  ; ; initially named after Canaanite fertility god Lehem The important holy site of Rachel's Tomb is located at the northern entrance of Bethlehem, though not freely accessible to the city's inhabitants due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.The earliest known mention of Bethlehem was in the Amarna correspondence of 1350xe2x80x931330 BCE when the town was inhabited by the Canaanites. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It continues by stating that Benjamin divined that the man on the throne was Joseph, so Joseph identified himself to Benjamin (but not the other brothers), and revealed his scheme (as in the Torah) to test how fraternal the other brothers were.Some classical rabbinical sources argue that Joseph identified himself for other reasons.In the narrative, just prior to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his brothers (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them; According to textual scholars, this is really the Jahwist's account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist's version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph's emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.An exterior view of a Mamluk [[caravanserai complex, including the mausoleum of Nabi Yamin, traditionally believed to be the tomb of Benjamin, located outside Kfar Saba, Israel. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This change includes a return to the white helmets with "charging buffalo" logo, and a return to royal blue instead of navy.On November 12, 2015, the Bills and the New York Jets became the first two teams to participate in the NFL's Color Rush uniform initiative, with Buffalo wearing an all-red combination for the first time in team history.A notable use of the Bills' uniforms outside of football was in the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, when the United States men's national junior ice hockey team wore Bills-inspired uniforms in their outdoor game against Team Canada on December 29, 2017.The Bills have rivalries with their three AFC East opponents, and also have had occasional or historical rivalries with other teams such as the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (a former divisional rival), Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans, Cleveland Browns, and Dallas Cowboys.Since then, the Bills have reached the playoffs in two of the past three NFL seasons and also clinched their first 10-win season in two decades in December 2019.The Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League led by head coach Buster Ramsey and joined the NFL as part of the AFLxe2x80x93NFL merger in 1970.The Bills' uniforms in its first two seasons were based on those of the Detroit Lions at the time.The team's original colors were Honolulu blue, silver and white, and the helmets were silver with no striping.The series heated up recently when former Jets head coach Rex Ryan became the Bills' head coach for two seasons, and has become notable again as Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Jets quarterback Sam Darnold, both drafted in the same year, maintain a friendly rivalry with one another.The Tennessee Titans (formerly the Houston Oilers) share an extended history with the Bills, both teams being original AFL clubs in 1960 and rivals in that league's East Division before the AFL-NFL merger. </my-abstract>

<headings> Definition ,  Order relation  , Operations , Searching ,  None or node.key  , Searching with duplicates allowed , Insertion , Deletion , Traversal ,  None:
        return
    traverse_binary_tree(node.leftChild, callback)

Traversal requires  time, since it must visit every node. This algorithm is also , so it is asymptotically optimal.
Traversal can also be implemented iteratively. For certain applications, e.g. greater equal search, approximative search, an operation for single step (iterative) traversal can be very useful. This is, of course, implemented without the callback construct and takes  on average and  in the worst case.
 , 
Sometimes we already have a binary tree, and we need to determine whether it is a BST. This problem has a simple recursive solution.
The BST property—every node on the right subtree has to be larger than the current node and every node on the left subtree has to be smaller than the current node—is the key to figuring out whether a tree is a BST or not. The greedy algorithm—simply traverse the tree, at every node check whether the node contains a value larger than the value at the left child and smaller than the value on the right child—does not work for all cases. Consider the following tree:
      20
     /  
   10    30
        /  
       5    40
In the tree above, each node meets the condition that the node contains a value larger than its left child and smaller than its right child hold, and yet it is not a BST: the value 5 is on the right subtree of the node containing 20, a violation of the BST property.
Instead of making a decision based solely on the values of a node and its children, we also need information flowing down from the parent as well. In the case of the tree above, if we could remember about the node containing the value 20, we would see that the node with value 5 is violating the BST property contract.
So the condition we need to check at each node is: 
A recursive solution in C++ can explain this further:
struct TreeNode {
    int key;
    int value;
    struct TreeNode *left;

 else if (key == root->key)    root->value = value;  else if (key < root->key)    insert(root->left, key, value);  else  // key > root->key    insert(root->right, key, value);}Alternatively, a non-recursive version might be implemented like this.If the direction is hard-wired, both choices, right and left, support a stack with insert duplicate as push operation and delete as the pop operation.def search_duplicatesAllowed(key, node):    current_node = node    while current_node != None:        if key < current_node.key:            current_node = current_node.left        else:  # key >= current_node.key:            current_node = current_node.right    return current_nodeA binary tree sort equipped with such a search function becomes stable.<!-- This section is linked from Red-black tree -->Insertion begins as a search would begin; if the key is not equal to that of the root, we search the left or right subtrees as before.This process continues, until the new node is compared with a leaf node, and then it is added as this node's right or left child, depending on its key: if the key is less than the leaf's key, then it is inserted as the leaf's left child, otherwise as the leaf's right child.There are other ways of inserting nodes into a binary tree, but this is the only way of inserting nodes at the leaves and at the same time preserving the BST structure.<!--This section is linked from Red-black tree-->When removing a node from a binary search tree it is mandatory to maintain the in-order sequence of the nodes.There are many possibilities to do this.Whether duplicates, i.& e. different elements with the same key, shall be allowed in the tree or not, does not depend on the order relation, but on the application only.For a search function supporting and handling duplicates in a tree, see section Searching with duplicates allowed.In the context of binary search trees, a total preorder is realized most flexibly by means of a three-way comparison subroutine.Binary search trees support three main operations: insertion of elements, deletion of elements, and lookup (checking whether a key is present).Searching in a binary search tree for a specific key can be programmed recursively or iteratively.We begin by examining the root node.It will call callback (some function the programmer wishes to call on the node's value, such as printing to the screen) for every node in the tree.def traverse_binary_tree(node, callback):    if node Verification NULL) return true;    if (node->key < minKey || node->key > maxKey) return false;        return isBST(node->left, minKey, node->key-1) && isBST(node->right, node->key+1, maxKey);}If we want the same elements to also be present, then we can use only <code>node->key</code> in both places.The initial call to this function can be something like this:if (isBST(root, INT_MIN, INT_MAX)) {    puts("This is a BST. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Each node N in the ordered tree corresponds to a node N'  in the binary tree; the left child of N'  is the node corresponding to the first child of N, and the right child of N'  is the node corresponding to N 's next sibling --- that is, the next node in order among the children of the parent of N. This binary tree representation of a general order tree is sometimes also referred to as a left-child right-sibling binary tree (also known as LCRS tree, doubly chained tree, filial-heir chain).One way of thinking about this is that each node's children are in a linked list, chained together with their right fields, and the node only has a pointer to the beginning or head of this list, through its left field.For example, in the tree on the left, A has the 6 children {B,C,D,E,F,G}.The bijection is then defined by letting the words <math>w_1</math> and <math>w_2</math> correspond to the binary trees that are the left and right children of the root.A bijective correspondence can also be defined as follows: enclose the Dyck word in an extra pair of parentheses, so that the result can be interpreted as a Lisp list expression (with the empty list () as only occurring atom); then the dotted-pair expression for that proper list is a fully parenthesized expression (with NIL as symbol and '.' as operator) describing the corresponding binary tree (which is, in fact, the internal representation of the proper list).The ability to represent binary trees as strings of symbols and parentheses implies that binary trees can represent the elements of a free magma on a singleton set.Binary trees can be constructed from programming language primitives in several ways.In a language with records and references, binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child.To show that no information is lost, we can convert the output back to the original tree like this: function DecodeSuccinct(bitstring structure, array data) {     remove first bit of structure and put it in b     if b = 1 then         create a new node n         remove first element of data and put it in n.data         n.left = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)         n.right = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)         return n     else         return nil }More sophisticated succinct representations allow not only compact storage of trees but even useful operations on those trees directly while they're still in their succinct form.There is a one-to-one mapping between general ordered trees and binary trees, which in particular is used by Lisp to represent general ordered trees as binary trees.If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special sentinel node.This method of storing binary trees wastes a fair bit of memory, as the pointers will be null (or point to the sentinel) more than half the time; a more conservative representation alternative is threaded binary tree.In languages with tagged unions such as ML, a tree node is often a tagged union of two types of nodes, one of which is a 3-tuple of data, left child, and right child, and the other of which is a "leaf" node, which contains no data and functions much like the null value in a language with pointers. </my-abstract>

<title>Boii</title>
<wiki-abstract> The Boii (Latin plural, singular Boius; ) were a Gallic tribe of the later Iron Age, attested at various times in Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), Pannonia (Hungary), parts of Bavaria, in and around Bohemia (after whom the region is named in most languages; comprising the bulk of Czechia), parts of Poland, and Gallia Narbonensis. In addition the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 2nd century BC Celts expanded from Bohemia through the Kłodzko Valley into Silesia, now part of Poland and Czechia. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> There are four games of Tavli commonly played:Portes: Set-up and rules the same as backgammon, except that backgammons count as gammons (2 points) and there is no doubling cube.Plakoto: A game where one checker can trap another checker on the same point.Fevga: A game where one checker by itself can block a point.Asodio: Also known as Acey-deucey, where all checkers are off the board, and players enter by rolling either doubles or acey-deucey.These games are played one after another, in matches of three, five, or seven points.In Japan, ban-sugoroku is thought to have been brought from China in the 6th century, and is mentioned in Genji monogatari.all six points are each occupied by two or more checkers), there is no roll that will allow a player to enter a checker from the bar, and that player stops rolling and playing until at least one point becomes open (occupied by one or zero checkers) due to the opponent's moves.When all of a player's checkers are in that player's home board, that player may start removing them; this is called "bearing off".If a player's checker is hit while in the process of bearing off, that player may not bear off any others until it has been re-entered into the game and moved into the player's home board, according to the normal movement rules.The first player to bear off all fifteen of their own checkers wins the game.Owing to this research, backgammon software has been developed that is capable of beating world-class human players (see TD-Gammon for an example).Board in starting position with two dice and doubling cubePaths of movement for red and black, with checkers in the starting position; viewed from the black side, with home or inner board at lower rightBackgammon is not controlled by a dominating authority, yet the "rules of play" are agreed on by the international tournaments.The objective is for players to remove (bear off) all their checkers from the board before their opponent can do the same.For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the lower die roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically. </my-abstract>

<title>Book of Joshua</title>
<wiki-abstract> The Book of Joshua ( ) is the sixth book in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament, and is the first book of the Deuteronomistic history, the story of Israel from the conquest of Canaan to the Babylonian exile. It tells of the campaigns of the Israelites in central, southern and northern Canaan, the destruction of their enemies, and the division of the land among the Twelve Tribes, framed by two set-piece speeches, the first by God commanding the conquest of the land, and, at the end, the second by Joshua warning of the need for faithful observance of the Law (torah) revealed to Moses. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> their allocated lands (Joshua 24:28).The Book of Joshua closes with three concluding items (referred to in the Jerusalem Bible as "Two Additions"):There were no Levitical cities given to the descendants of Aaron in Ephraim, so theologians Carl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delitzsch supposed the land may have been at Geba in the territory of the Tribe of Benjamin: "the situation, 'upon the mountains of Ephraim', is not at variance with this view, as these mountains extended, according to Judges 4:5, etc., far into the territory of Benjamin".In some manuscripts and editions of the Septuagint, there is an additional verse relating to the apostasy of the Israelites after Joshua's death.The Book of Joshua is an anonymous work.The Babylonian Talmud, written in the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, attributed it to Joshua himself, but this idea was rejected as untenable by John Calvin (1509xe2x80x9364), and by the time of Thomas Hobbes (1588xe2x80x931679) it was recognised that the book must have been written much later than the period it depicted.The prevailing scholarly view is that Joshua is not a factual account of historical events.In the 1930s Martin Noth made a sweeping criticism of the usefulness of the Book of Joshua for history.In 1955, G. Ernest Wright discussed the correlation of archaeological data to the early Israelite campaigns, which he divided into three phases per the Book of Joshua. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> "The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character& ... serves as the principal human 'hero' in the biblical book that now bears his name"; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions from on high that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries.The prophecies of Daniel are accurate down to the career of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, king of Syria and oppressor of the Jews, but not in its prediction of his death: the author seems to know about Antiochus' two campaigns in Egypt (169 and 167 BCE), the desecration of the Temple (the "abomination of desolation"), and the fortification of the Akra (a fortress built inside Jerusalem), but he seems to know nothing about the reconstruction of the Temple or about the actual circumstances of Antiochus' death in late 164 BCE.None reveal any major disagreements against the Masoretic, and the four scrolls that preserve the relevant sections (1QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>a</sup>, 4QDan<sup>b</sup>, and 4QDan<sup>d</sup>) all follow the bilingual nature of Daniel where the book opens in Hebrew, switches to Aramaic at 2:4b, then reverts to Hebrew at 8:1.(This section deals with modern scholarly reconstructions of the meaning of Daniel to its original authors and audience)The Book of Daniel is an apocalypse, a literary genre in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an other-worldly mediator, an emphasis on cosmic events, angels and demons, and pseudonymity (false authorship).It divides into two parts, a set of six court tales in chapters 1xe2x80x936, written mostly in Aramaic, and four apocalyptic visions in chapters 7xe2x80x9312, written mostly in Hebrew; the  deuterocanon contains three additional stories, the Song of the Three Holy Children,  Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon.The book's influence has resonated through later ages, from the community of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the authors of the gospels and of  Revelation, to various movements from the 2nd century to the Protestant Reformation and modern  millennialist movementsxe2x80x94on which it continues to have a profound influence.The Book of Daniel is divided between the court tales of chapters 1xe2x80x936 and the apocalyptic visions of 7xe2x80x9312, and between the Hebrew of chapters 1 and 8xe2x80x9312 and the Aramaic of chapters 2xe2x80x937. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Despite not having an immediate continuation, the series spawned a (failed) pilot episode for a spin-off Batgirl television series and, decades later, the Batman '66 (2013-2016) comic book series and the animated films Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders (2016) and Batman vs. Two-Face (2017), and even the mockumentary Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt (2003).The popularity of the Batman TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in The Batman/Superman Hour; the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as The Adventures of Batman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977.In 2018, when the series was renewed for its fifth and final season it was announced that Batman would make an appearance in the show's series finale's flash-forward.Iain Glen portrays Bruce Wayne in the live-action series Titans, appearing in the show's second season in 2019.To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the character, Warner Bros aired the television short film, Batman: Strange Days, that was also posted on DC's YouTube channel.In August 2019, it was announced that Kevin Conroy would make his live-action television debut as an older Bruce Wayne in the upcoming Arrowverse crossover, Crisis on Infinite Earths.Batman's first cinematographic adventures consisted of the 1943 serial film Batman and its 1949 sequel Batman and Robin, which both depicted a government-backed version of Batman and Robin (censorship would not have allowed for vigilantes to be depicted as unauthorized crimefighters).Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's "No Man's Land".Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of "Batman: Officer Down" and "Batman: War Games/War Crimes"; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Bullock are forced out of the police department in "Officer Down", while "War Games" and "War Crimes" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the sadistic Black Mask the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs.They include: Barbara Gordon, Commissioner Gordon's daughter, who has fought crime under the vigilante identity of Batgirl and, during a period in which she was confined to a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker, the computer hacker Oracle; Helena Bertinelli, the sole surviving member of a mob family turned vigilante, who has worked with Batman on occasion, primarily as the Huntress and as Batgirl for a brief stint; Cassandra Cain, the daughter of professional assassins David Cain, and Lady Shiva, who succeeded Bertinelli as Batgirl.;CiviliansLucius Fox, a technology specialist and Bruce Wayne's business manager who is well aware of his employer's clandestine vigilante activities; Dr. Leslie Thompkins, a family friend who like Alfred became a surrogate parental figure to Bruce Wayne after the deaths of his parents, and is also aware of his secret identity; Vicki Vale, an investigative journalist who often reports on Batman's activities for the Gotham Gazette; Ace the Bat-Hound, Batman's canine partner who was mainly active in the 1950s and 1960s; and Bat-Mite, an extra-dimensional imp mostly active in the 1960s who idolizes Batman.;GCPDAs Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, Commissioner James "Jim" Gordon debuted along with Batman in Detective Comics #27 and has been a consistent presence ever since.The first installment, Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), was released by Rocksteady Studios to critical acclaim; review aggregator Metacritic reports it as having received 92% positive reviews.Mayfair Games published the DC Heroes role-playing game in 1985, then published the 80-page supplement Batman the following year, written by Mike Stackpole, with cover art by Ed Hannigan.Mayfair released a simplified version of DC Heroes called The Batman Role-Playing Game in 1989 to coincide with the Batman film.Gay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist Fredric Wertham asserted in Seduction of the Innocent in 1954 that "Batman stories are psychologically homosexual& ...(which, among other, depicts Batman's first meeting with both Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson, and their becoming Batgirl and Robin/Nightwing, respectively), and for the sequel The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019), which curiously depicts Batman's wedding to an original character.In 2016, Ben Affleck began portraying Batman in the DC Extended Universe with the release of the film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, directed by Zack Snyder,Dante Pereira-Olson portrays a young Bruce Wayne in the 2019 film Joker.In 2019 Robert Pattinson was cast to play Batman in an upcoming reboot of the franchise, The Batman, releasing in 2021.The series became #1 on the Diamond Comic Distributors sales chart for the first time since Batman #500 (Oct. 1993) and Todd's appearance laid the groundwork for writer Judd Winick's subsequent run as writer on Batman, with another multi-issue arc, "Under the Hood", which ran from Batman #637xe2x80x93650 (April 2005 xe2x80x93 April 2006).In 2005, DC launched All-Star Batman and Robin, a stand-alone comic series set outside the main DC Universe continuity. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Bastarnae may have been involved in the Dacian Wars of Domitian (86xe2x80x9388) and Trajan (101xe2x80x93102 and 105xe2x80x93106), since these took place in the lower Danube region and it is known that both sides were supported by neighbouring indigenous tribes.In the late 2nd century, the Historia Augusta mentions that in the rule of Marcus Aurelius (161xe2x80x93180), an alliance of lower Danube tribes including the Bastarnae, the Sarmatian Roxolani and the Costoboci took advantage of the emperor's difficulties on the upper Danube (the Marcomannic Wars) to invade Roman territory.During the late 2nd century, the main ethnic change in the northern Black Sea region was the immigration, from the Vistula valley in the North, of the Goths and accompanying Germanic tribes such as the Taifali and the Hasdingi, a branch of the Vandal people.Inscription AE (1905) 14 records a campaign on the Hungarian Plain by the Augustan-era general Marcus Vinucius: <blockquote>Marcus Vinucius...[patronymic], Consul [in 19 BC]...[various official titles], governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the Cotini, Osi,...[missing tribal name] and Anartii to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome.</blockquote> Most likely, the Bastarnae, in alliance with Dacians, were attempting to assist the hard-pressed Illyrian/Celtic tribes of Pannonia in their resistance to Rome.It appears that in the final years of Augustus' rule, the Bastarnae made their peace with Rome.In the mid-3rd century, the Bastarnae were part of a Gothic-led grand coalition of lower Danube tribes that repeatedly invaded the Balkan provinces of the Roman Empire.Many Bastarnae were resettled within the Roman Empire in the late 3rd century.According to Polybius (200xe2x80x93118 BC):"A mission from the Dardanians now arrived, telling of the Bastarnae, their numbers, the huge size and the valour of their warriors, and also pointing out that Perseus and the Galatians were in league with this tribe.The Greek geographer Strabo (writing c. 5xe2x80x9320 AD) says the Bastarnae are "of Germanic stock".The Roman historian Tacitus (c. 100 AD) describes the Bastarnae as Germans with substantial Sarmatian influence, but moves on to state: "The Peucini, however, who are sometimes called Bastarnae, are like the Germans in their language, way of life and types of dwelling. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The jurisdiction of the Holy Roman Empire was definitively reasserted when Jaromxc3xadr of Bohemia was granted fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia by Emperor King Henry II of the Holy Roman Empire, with the promise that he hold it as a vassal once he re-occupied Prague with a German army in 1004,  ending the rule of Boleslaw I of Poland.The first to use the title of "King of Bohemia" were the Pxc5x99emyslid dukes Vratislav II (1085) and Vladislav II (1158), but their heirs would return to the title of duke.In 1609, Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II, who made Prague again the capital of the Empire at the time, himself a Roman Catholic, was moved by the Bohemian nobility to publish Maiestas Rudolphina, which confirmed the older Confessio Bohemica of 1575.After Emperor Matthias II and then King of Bohemia Ferdinand II (later Holy Roman Emperor) began oppressing the rights of Protestants in Bohemia, the resulting Bohemian Revolt led to outbreak of the Thirty Years' War in 1618.The renewal of the old Bohemian Crown (Kingdom of Bohemia, Margraviate of Moravia, and Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia) became the official political program of both Czech liberal politicians and the majority of Bohemian aristocracy ("state rights program"), while parties representing the German minority and small part of the aristocracy proclaimed their loyalty to the centralistic Constitution (so-called "Verfassungstreue").After the defeat of Austria in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Hungarian politicians achieved the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, ostensibly creating equality between the Austrian and Hungarian halves of the empire. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The French pursued Wellington's retreating army to Waterloo; however, due to bad weather, mud and the head start that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry action at Genappe, there was no substantial engagement.As 17 June drew to a close, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following.Zieten resumed his march to support Wellington directly, and the arrival of his troops allowed Wellington to reinforce his crumbling centre by moving cavalry from his left.The French were expecting Grouchy to march to their support from Wavre, and when Prussian I Corps (Zieten's) appeared at Waterloo instead of Grouchy, "the shock of disillusionment shattered French morale" and "the sight of Zieten's arrival caused turmoil to rage in Napoleon's army".}}At approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th Lxc3xa9gxc3xa8re, renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out.It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with Bylandt's brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right.This was done because, being on the left of the four divisions, it was ordered to send one (Quiot's brigade) against the south and west of La Haye Sainte, while the other (Bourgeois') was to attack the eastern side of the same post.The divisions were to advance in echelon from the left at a distance of 400 paces apartxe2x80x94the 2nd Division (Donzelot's) on the right of Bourgeois' brigade, the 3rd Division (Marcognet's) next, and the 4th Division (Durutte's) on the right.Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.Reports from Baron von Mxc3xbcffling, the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: "After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon". }}At this crucial juncture, Uxbridge ordered his two brigades of British heavy cavalryxe2x80x94formed unseen behind the ridgexe2x80x94to charge in support of the hard-pressed infantry.Blxc3xbccher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack..}} General Bxc3xbclow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.At about this time, the Prussian 15th Brigade () was sent to link up with the Nassauers of Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont-La Haie area, with the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support.At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to "head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]" and then "push before him" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo "as soon as possible".At 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's Aboriginal peoples, and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together.Recent evidence also suggests that boomerangs were used as war weapons., with MTA boomerangs (boomerangs used for the maximum-time-aloft event) often under .Boomerangs have also been suggested as an alternative to clay pigeons in shotgun sports, where the flight of the boomerang better mimics the flight of a bird offering a more challenging target.The modern boomerang is often computer-aided designed with precision airfoils.Its surfaces are therefore symmetrical and not with the aerofoils that give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.The most recognisable type of the boomerang is the L-shaped returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or kylies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Some recent clinical studies have shown that low-dose HGH treatment for adults with HGH deficiency changes the body composition by increasing muscle mass, decreasing fat mass, increasing bone density and muscle strength, improves cardiovascular parameters, and affects the quality of life without significant side effects.In rodents, knockdown of metallothionein gene expression results in activation of the Akt pathway and increases in myotube size, in type IIb fiber hypertrophy, and ultimately in muscle strength.Sesame oil is often used in such mixtures, which can cause allergic reactions such as vasculitis.As the injected muscle is not actually well-developed, it might droop under gravity.Although muscle stimulation occurs in the gym (or home gym) when lifting weights, muscle growth occurs afterward during rest periods.Besides the many "Mr. XXX" (insert town, city, state, or region) championships, the most prestigious titles were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia, which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world.During the 1950s, the most successful and most famous competing bodybuilders were Bill Pearl, Reg Park, Leroy Colbert, and Clarence Ross.In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the "freakish" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.Due to the number of people who found bodybuilding to be "too big" or "ugly" and unhealthy, a new category was started in 2013. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases as well as the threat of alleged use of biological weapons against BTWC States Parties.It is important to note that most classical and modern biological weapons' pathogens can be obtained from a plant or an animal which is naturally infected.Indeed, in the largest biological weapons accident knownxe2x80x94the anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in the Soviet Union in 1979xe2x80x94sheep became ill with anthrax as far as 200 kilometers from the release point of the organism from a military facility in the southeastern portion of the city and still off-limits to visitors today, (see Sverdlovsk Anthrax leak).For example, in the case of anthrax, it is likely that by 24xe2x80x9336 hours after an attack, some small percentage of individuals (those with the compromised immune system or who had received a large dose of the organism due to proximity to the release point) will become ill with classical symptoms and signs (including a virtually unique chest X-ray finding, often recognized by public health officials if they receive timely reports).#Single cause of a certain disease caused by an uncommon agent, with lack of an epidemiological explanation.#Unusual, rare, genetically engineered strain of an agent.#High morbidity and mortality rates in regards to patients with the same or similar symptoms.#Unusual presentation of the disease.#Unusual geographic or seasonal distribution.#Stable endemic disease, but with an unexplained increase in relevance.#Rare transmission (aerosols, food, water).#No illness presented in people who were/are not exposed to "common ventilation systems (have separate closed ventilation systems) when illness is seen in persons in close proximity who have a common ventilation system.Entomological (insect) warfare is a subtype of BW.Biological warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare, chemical warfare and radiological warfare, which together with biological warfare make up CBRN, the military initialism for nuclear, biological, radiological, and chemical warfare using weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)."#Different and unexplained diseases coexisting in the same patient without any other explanation.#Rare illness that affects a large, disparate population (respiratory disease might suggest the pathogen or agent was inhaled).#Illness is unusual for a certain population or age-group in which it takes presence.#Unusual trends of death and/or illness in animal populations, previous to or accompanying illness in humans.#Many affected reaching out for treatment at the same time.#Similar genetic makeup of agents in affected individuals.#Simultaneous collections of similar illness in non-contiguous areas, domestic, or foreign.#An abundance of cases of unexplained diseases and deaths.The goal of biodefense is to integrate the sustained efforts of the national and homeland security, medical, public health, intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement communities.During the first Gulf War the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, Task Force Scorpio, to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.The traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.The growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> the author of the text) had neither the same audience nor, potentially, the same intent that Jeremiah had in performing these prophetic gestures.The following is a list xe2x80x93 not exhaustive xe2x80x93 of noteworthy sign-acts found in Jeremiah:The influence of Jeremiah during and after the Exile was considerable in some circles, and three additional books, the Book of Baruch, Lamentations, and the Letter of Jeremiah, were attributed to him in Second Temple Judaism (Judaism in the period between the building of the Second Temple in about 515 BCE and its destruction in 70 CE); in the Greek Septuagint they stand between Jeremiah and the Book of Ezekiel, but only Lamentations is included in modern Jewish or Protestant bibles (the Letter of Jeremiah appears in Catholic bibles as the sixth chapter of Baruch).This suggests that the superscription is trying to make a theological point about Jeremiah by comparing him to Moses xe2x80x93 where Moses spent forty years leading Israel from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land, Jeremiah's forty years saw Israel exiled from the land and Jeremiah himself ultimately in exile in Egypt.Much of Jeremiah's prophetic preaching is based on the theme of the covenant between God and Israel (God would protect the people in return for their exclusive worship of him): Jeremiah insists that the covenant is conditional, and can be broken by Israel's apostasy (worship of gods other than Yahweh, the God of Israel). </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The newer approach looks at the book in terms of its literary and formal characteristics, rather than authors, and sees in it a two-part structure divided between chapters 33 and 34:Michelangelo (c. 1508xe2x80x9312), Isaiah, [[Vatican City: Sistine Chapel ceiling]]Seeing Isaiah as a two-part book (chapters 1xe2x80x9333 and 34xe2x80x9366) with an overarching theme leads to a summary of its contents like the following:The older understanding of this book as three fairly discrete sections attributable to identifiable authors leads to a more atomised picture of its contents, as in this example:Scroll of Book of IsaiahWhile it is widely accepted that the book of Isaiah is rooted in a historic prophet called Isaiah, who lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the 8th century BCE, it is also widely accepted that this prophet did not write the entire book of Isaiah.Isaiah 7:14, where the prophet is assuring king Ahaz that God will save Judah from the invading armies of Israel and Syria, forms the basis for Matthew 1:23's doctrine of the virgin birth, while Isaiah 40:3xe2x80x935's image of the exiled Israel led by God and proceeding home to Jerusalem on a newly constructed road through the wilderness was taken up by all four Gospels and applied to John the Baptist and Jesus.Isaiah seems always to have had a prominent place in Jewish Bible use, and it is probable that Jesus himself was deeply influenced by Isaiah. </my-abstract>

It was leather that had been treated so that it became tough and rigid, as well as able to hold moulded decoration. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> Cuir bouilli was also often used for elaborate figurative crests on some helmets.The material is mentioned in Froissart's Chronicles of the Hundred Years' War, and Geoffrey Chaucer, in his Canterbury Tales, written in the late 1300s, says of the knight Sir Thopas:Ffoulkes, 97xe2x80x9398; (Note: jambeaux are greaves xe2x80x93 shin armour).The large decorative crests that came to top some helmets in the late Middle Ages were often made of cuir bouilli, as is the famous example belonging to the Black Prince and hung with other "achievements" over his tomb in Canterbury Cathedral.As well as the crests on helmets described above, cuir bouilli was probably used sculpturally in various contexts, over a wood or plaster framework where necessary. </my-abstract>

<title>Buffer overflow</title>
<wiki-abstract> In information security and programming, a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> In this example "e" followed by a zero byte would become 25856.Writing data past the end of allocated memory can sometimes be detected by the operating system to generate a segmentation fault error that terminates the process.To prevent the buffer overflow from happening in this example, the call to <kbd>strcpy</kbd> could be replaced with <kbd>strlcpy</kbd>, which takes the maximum capacity of A (including a null-termination character) as an additional parameter and ensures that no more than this amount of data is written to A:strlcpy(A, "excessive", sizeof(A));When available, the <kbd>strlcpy</kbd> library function is preferred over <kbd>strncpy</kbd> which does not null-terminate the destination buffer if the source string's length is greater than or equal to the size of the buffer (the third argument passed to the function), therefore <kbd>A</kbd> may not be null-terminated and cannot be treated as a valid C-style string.The techniques to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability vary by architecture, by operating system and by memory region.This can occur when copying data from one buffer to another without first checking that the data fits within the destination buffer.In the following example expressed in C, a program has two variables which are adjacent in memory: an 8-byte-long string buffer, A, and a two-byte big-endian integer, B.char           A[8] = "";unsigned short B    = 1979;Initially, A contains nothing but zero bytes, and B contains the number 1979.Now, the program attempts to store the null-terminated string  with ASCII encoding in the A buffer.strcpy(A, "excessive"); is 9 characters long and encodes to 10 bytes including the null terminator, but A can take only 8 bytes. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Numbers also demonstrates the importance of holiness, faithfulness and trust: despite God's presence and his priests, Israel lacks faith and the possession of the land is left to a new generation.Most commentators divide Numbers into three sections based on locale (Mount Sinai, Kadesh-Barnea and the plains of Moab), linked by two travel sections; an alternative is to see it as structured around the two generations of those condemned to die in the wilderness and the new generation who will enter Canaan, making a theological distinction between the disobedience of the first generation and the obedience of the second.God orders Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, to number those able to bear armsxe2x80x94of all the men "from twenty years old and upward," and to appoint princes over each tribe. </my-abstract>

<title>Books of Samuel</title>
<wiki-abstract> The Book of Samuel forms part of the narrative history of Israel in the Nevi'im or "prophets" section of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament called the Deuteronomistic history, a series of books (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) that constitute a theological history of the Israelites and aim to explain God's law for Israel under the guidance of the prophets. According to Jewish tradition, the book was written by Samuel, with additions by the prophets Gad and Nathan. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> For example, A. Graeme Auld, Professor of Hebrew Bible at the University of Edinburgh, contends that the silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 "almost certainly fixes the date of this story in the Persian or Hellenistic period" because a quarter-shekel was known to exist in Hasmonean times.The 6th century BC authors and editors responsible for the bulk of the history drew on many earlier sources, including (but not limited to) an "ark narrative" (1 Samuel 4:1xe2x80x937:1 and perhaps part of 2 Samuel 6), a "Saul cycle" (parts of 1 Samuel 9xe2x80x9311 and 13xe2x80x9314), the "history of David's rise" (1 Samuel 16:14xe2x80x932 Samuel 5:10), and the "succession narrative" (2 Samuel 9xe2x80x9320 and 1 Kings 1xe2x80x932).Saul has two faults which make him unfit for the office of king: carrying out a sacrifice in place of Samuel (1 Samuel 13:8xe2x80x9314), and failing to exterminate the Amalekites, in accordance to God's commands, and trying to compensate by claiming that he reserved the surviving Amalekite livestock for sacrifice (1 Samuel 15).One of the main units within Samuel is the "History of David's Rise", the purpose of which is to justify David as the legitimate successor to Saul. </my-abstract>

<title>Book of Ruth</title>
<wiki-abstract> The Book of Ruth (abbreviated Rth) (, Megilath Ruth, "the Scroll of Ruth", one of the Five Megillot) is included in the third division, or the Writings (Ketuvim), of the Hebrew Bible; in most Christian canons it is treated as a history book and placed between Judges and 1 Samuel. </wiki-abstract>

<headings> Structure , Summary , Composition , Themes and background , 
The Book of Ruth illustrates the difficulty of trying to use laws given in books such as Deuteronomy as evidence of actual practice. Naomi plans to provide security for herself and Ruth by arranging a levirate marriage with Boaz. She instructs Ruth to uncover Boaz's feet after he has gone to sleep and lie down. When Boaz wakes up, surprised to see a woman at his feet, Ruth explains she wants him to redeem (and thus marry) her. Many modern commentators see sexual allusions in this part of the story, with 'feet' as a euphemism for genitals.
Since there was no heir to inherit Elimelech's land, custom required a close relative (usually the dead man's brother) to marry the widow of the deceased in order to continue his family line (Deuteronomy 25:5–10). This relative was called the go'el, the "kinsman-redeemer". As Boaz is not Elimelech's brother, nor is Ruth his widow, scholars refer to the arrangement here as "Levirate-like". A complication arises in the story: another man is a closer relative to Elimelech than Boaz and has first claim on Ruth. It is resolved through the custom that required land to stay in the family: a family could mortgage land to ward off poverty, but the law required a kinsman to purchase it back into the family (Leviticus 25:25ff). Boaz meets the near kinsman at the city gate (the place where contracts are settled); the kinsman first says he will purchase Elimelech's (now Naomi's) land, but, upon hearing he must also take Ruth as his wife, withdraws his offer. Boaz thus becomes Ruth and Naomi's "kinsman-redeemer."
 , 
The book can be read as a political parable relating to issues around the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (the 4th century BCE). The realistic nature of the story is established from the start through the names of the participants: the husband and father is Elimelech, meaning "My God is King", and his wife is Naomi, "Pleasing", but after the deaths of her sons Mahlon, "Sickness", and Chilion, "Wasting", she asks to be called Mara, "Bitter". The reference to Moab raises questions, since in the rest of the biblical literature it is associated with hostility to Israel, sexual perversity, and idolatry, and  excluded an Ammonite or a Moabite from "the congregation of the ; even to their tenth generation". Despite this, Ruth the Moabite married a Judahite and even after his death still regarded herself a member of his family; she then married another Judahite and bore him a son who became an ancestor of David. Concerning this, the Mishnah says that only male Moabites are banned from the congregation. Unlike the story of Ezra–Nehemiah, where marriages between Jewish men and non-Jewish women were broken up, Ruth teaches that foreigners who convert to Judaism can become good Jews, foreign wives can become exemplary followers of Jewish law, and there is no reason to exclude them or their offspring from the community.
 , 
Scholars have increasingly explored Ruth in ways which allow it to address contemporary issues. Feminists, for example, have recast the story as one of the dignity of labour and female self-sufficiency, and a model for lesbian relations, while others have seen in it a celebration of the relationship between strong and resourceful women. Others have criticised it for its underlying, and potentially exploitative, acceptance of a system of patriarchy in which a woman's worth can only be measured through marriage and child-bearing. Others again have seen it as a book that champions outcast and oppressed peoples.

<my-abstract> It translates the Hebrew Esther but interpolates translations of the Greek Esther where the latter provides additional material.Several Aramaic targums of Esther were produced in the Middle Ages of which two survive xe2x80x93 the Targum Rishon ("First Targum") and Targum Sheni ("Second Targum") These were not targums ("translations") in the true sense but like the Greek Esther are retellings of events and include additional legends relating to Purim.The apparent historical difficulties, the internal inconsistencies, the pronounced symmetry of themes and events, the plenitude of quoted dialogue, and the gross exaggeration in the reporting of numbers (involving time, money, and people) all point to Esther as a work of fiction, its vivid characters (except for Xerxes) being the product of the author's creative imagination.According to some sources, it is a historical novella, written to explain the origin of the Jewish holiday of Purim.As noted by biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan, the book contains specific details regarding certain subject matter (for example, Persian rule) which are historically inaccurate.The books of Esther and Song of Songs are the only books in the Hebrew Bible that do not mention God.Assuming that Ahasuerus is indeed Xerxes I, the events described in Esther began around the years 483xe2x80x9382 BC, and concluded in March 473 BC.Classical sources such as Josephus, the Jewish commentary Esther Rabbah and the Christian theologian Bar-Hebraeus, as well as the Greek Septuagint translation of Esther, instead identify Ahasuerus as either Artaxerxes I (reigned 465 to 424 BC) or Artaxerxes II (reigned 404 to 358 BC).On his accession, however, Artaxerxes II lost Egypt to pharaoh Amyrtaeus, after which it was no longer part of the Persian empire. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In 2016, Green MP, Caroline Lucas, put forward a Bill that would have seen the rail network fall back into public ownership step by step, as franchises come up for expiry.Under Jeremy Corbyn (2015&ndash;2020), the Labour Party pledged to gradually renationalise British Rail franchises if elected, as and when their private contracts expire, creating a "People's Railway".In 1989, the ITV Sketch Show Spitting Image parodied Hudson's 1988 British Rail, Britain's Railway advert on the plans of the then Conservative British Government to privatise the railways featuring many of the show's puppets (including the show's portrayal of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher), numerous BR trains and landmarks and even a cardboard cutout of Thomas the Tank Engine. 'During the 1980s British Rail ran the Rail Riders membership club aimed at 5- to 15-year-olds.Because British Railways was such a large operation, running not just railways but also ferries, steamships and hotels, it has been considered difficult to analyse the effects of nationalisation.Development of a corporate identity for the organisation was hampered by the competing ambitions of the British Transport Commission and the Railway Executive.As international travel became more popular in the late 1960s and before air travel became generally affordable, the responsibility for shipping services was taken away from the British Rail Regions and in 1969 centralised in a new division xe2x80x93 British Rail Shipping and International Services Division.With the advent of car ferry services, the old passenger-only ferries were gradually replaced by roll-on/roll-off ships, catering for motorists and rail passengers as well as road freight.The agreement with the SNCF on the Dover to Calais route also ended at this time and the French-run Sealink services were rebranded as SeaFrance.The joint hovercraft services of British Rail (under British Rail Hovercraft Limited) in association with the French SNCF. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Apart from Revelation, however, where Ezekiel is a major source, there is very little allusion to the prophet in the New Testament; the reasons for this are  unclear, but it cannot be assumed that every Christian or Hellenistic Jewish community in the 1st century would have had a complete set of (Hebrew) scripture scrolls, and in any case Ezekiel was under suspicion of encouraging dangerous mystical speculation, as well as being sometimes obscure, incoherent, and pornographic.File:Secondtempleplan.jpg|The Visionary Ezekiel Temple plan drawn by the 19th-century French architect and Bible scholar Charles Chipiez.File:The Vision of The Valley of The Dry Bones.jpg|The Vision of The Valley of The Dry Bones by Gustave Dorxc3xa9, 1866File:Marten de Vos 001.jpg|Ezekiel's Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones by Maerten de Vos, c. 1600File:Quinten Massys Vision des Propheten Ezechiels.jpg|Ezekiel's Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones by Quentin Metsys the Younger, c. 1589;Online translations ' </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> This is an obviously beneficial tool in fighting bioterrorism as it provides a means through which such attacks could be discovered in their nascence; assuming bioterrorist attacks result in similar symptoms across the board, this strategy allows New York City to respond immediately to any bioterrorist threats that they may face with some level of alacrity.Government agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement, hazardous materials and decontamination units, and emergency medical units, if available.The US military has specialized units, which can respond to a bioterrorism event; among them are the United States Marine Corps' Chemical Biological Incident Response Force and the U.S. Army's 20th Support Command (CBRNE), which can detect, identify, and neutralize threats, and decontaminate victims exposed to bioterror agents.As with US attempts to categorize harmful recreational drugs, designer viruses are not yet categorized and avian H5N1 has been shown to achieve high mortality and human-communication in a laboratory setting.These high-priority agents pose a risk to national security, can be easily transmitted and disseminated, result in high mortality, have potential major public health impact, may cause public panic, or require special action for public health preparedness.Category B agents are moderately easy to disseminate and have low mortality rates.Category C agents are emerging pathogens that might be engineered for mass dissemination because of their availability, ease of production and dissemination, high mortality rate, or ability to cause a major health impact.There are multiple considerable scenarios, how terrorists might employ biological agents. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The genus name Castor is Latin and derives from the Greek kastor which translates as "beaver" or "he who excels".There are two extant species of beavers: the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and the Eurasian beaver (C. fiber).The beaver is famed for its industriousness and its building skills, and has been a popular symbol in Canada.The English word "beaver" comes from the Old English word beofor or befer (recorded earlier as bebr), which in turn sprang from the Proto-Germanic root *bebruz.Beaver families may also dig channels at the bottom of their pond, which can retain water during a drought.The beaver works as a keystone species in an ecosystem by creating wetlands that are used by many other species. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b'      DESCRIPTION: Species of bear found across Eurasia and North America.. }}The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America.While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total estimated  population in 2017 of 110,000. , this and the American black bear are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN.The scientific name of the brown bear, Ursus arctos, comes from the Latin , meaning "bear",Brown bears are thought to have evolved from Ursus etruscus in Asia.Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: inland brown bears, also known as grizzlies, are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan peninsula.The point at which the polar bear diverged from the brown bear is unclear, with estimations based on genetics and fossils ranging from 400,000 to 70,000 years ago, but most recent analysis has indicated that the polar bear split somewhere between 275,000 and 150,000 years ago.DNA analysis shows that, apart from recent human-caused population fragmentation,Brown bears are apparently divided into five different clades, some of which coexist or co-occur in different regions.A grizzlyxe2x80x93polar bear hybrid (known either as a pizzly bear or a grolar bear) is a rare ursid hybrid resulting from a crossbreeding of a brown bear and a polar bear.Previously, the hybrid had been produced in zoos and was considered a "cryptid" (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild).Analyses of the genomes of bears have shown that introgression between species was widespread during the evolution of the genus Ursus, including the introgression of polar bear DNA introduced to brown bears during the Pleistocene.A bear shot in autumn 1986 in Michigan, US, was thought by some to be a grizzly/American black bear hybrid, due to its unusually large size and its proportionately larger braincase and skull. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> BCS theory or Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory (named after John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer) is the first microscopic theory of superconductivity since  Heike Kamerlingh Onnes's 1911 discovery. The theory describes superconductivity as a microscopic effect caused by a condensation of Cooper pairs. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The original results of BCS (discussed below) described an s-wave superconducting state, which is the rule among low-temperature superconductors but is not realized in many unconventional superconductors such as the d-wave high-temperature superconductors.Extensions of BCS theory exist to describe these other cases, although they are insufficient to completely describe the observed features of high-temperature superconductivity.BCS is able to give an approximation for the quantum-mechanical many-body state of the system of (attractively interacting) electrons inside the metal. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In this 15& km for men or 12.5& km for women competition, the distance is skied over five laps; there are four bouts of shooting (two prone, two standing, in that order) with the first shooting bout being at the lane corresponding to the competitor's bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), with the rest of the shooting bouts being on a first-come, first-served basis (If a competitor arrives at the lane in fifth place, they shoot at lane 5).The distance is 12.5& km for men and 10& km for women, skied over five laps; there are four shooting bouts (two prone, two standing, in that order), and each miss means a penalty loop of 150& m. To prevent awkward or dangerous crowding of the skiing loops, and overcapacity at the shooting range, World Cup Pursuits are held with only the 60 top ranking biathletes after the preceding race.On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots on a first-come, first-served basis (arrive at the range in fifth place, shoot at lane 5).The most recent addition to the number of biathlon competition variants, the mixed relay is similar to the ordinary relay but the teams are composed of two women and two men. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> b'      BASE jumping is the recreational sport of jumping from fixed objects, using a parachute to descend safely to the ground."BASE" is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: building, antenna, span, and earth (cliff).Participants exit from a fixed object such as a cliff, and after an optional freefall delay, deploy a parachute to slow their descent and land.A popular form of BASE jumping is wingsuit BASE jumping.In contrast to other forms of parachuting, such as skydiving from airplanes, BASE jumps are performed from fixed objects which are generally much lower altitude, and BASE jumpers typically carry only one parachute.BASE jumping is significantly more hazardous than other forms of parachuting, and is widely considered to be one of the most dangerous extreme sports.Fausto Veranzio is widely believed to have been the first person to build and test a parachute,Francis Trevelyan Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MdDNAAAAMAAJ The world in the air: the story of flying in pictures], G.P.The primary distinguishing characteristic of low BASE jumps versus high BASE jumps is the use of a slider reefing device to control the opening speed of the parachute, and whether the jumper falls long enough to reach terminal velocity.Low BASE jumps are those where the jumper does not reach terminal velocity.High BASE jumps are often called "slider up" jumps due to the use of a slider reefing device.High BASE jumps present different hazards than low BASE jumps. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The prominence of prophecy is quite apparent in Zechariah, but it is also true that Zechariah (along with Haggai) allows prophecy to yield to the priesthood; this is particularly apparent in comparing Zechariah to "Third Isaiah" (chapters 55xe2x80x9366 of the Book of Isaiah), whose author was active sometime after the first return from exile.Most Christian commentators read the series of predictions in chapters 7 to 14 as Messianic prophecies, either directly or indirectly. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> These elaborations and disputes gave rise to various schools in early Buddhism of Abhidharma, and to the Mahayana traditions such as Prajnaparamita, Madhyamaka, Buddha-nature and Yogxc4x81cxc4x81ra.Edward Conze splits the development of Indian Buddhist philosophy into three phases:# The phase of the original doctrines derived from oral traditions that originated during the life of the Buddha, and are common to all later sects of Buddhism.# The second phase concerns non-Mahayana "scholastic" Buddhism, as evident in the Abhidharma texts beginning in the third century BCE that feature scholastic reworking and schematic classification of material in the sutras.# The third phase of development of Indian Buddhist philosophy concerns Mahayana "metaphysical" Buddhism, beginning in the late first century CE, which emphasizes monastic life and the path of a bodhisattva.Various elements of these three phases are incorporated and/or further developed in the philosophy and world view of the various sects of Buddhism that then emerged.Philosophy in India was aimed mainly at spiritual liberation and had soteriological goals.The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the tathxc4x81gatagarbha genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of dependent origination using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism.In these sutras, the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used previously in Indian philosophy by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.The word "self" (atman) is used in a way idiosyncratic to these sutras; the "true self" is described as the perfection of the wisdom of not-self in the Buddha-Nature Treatise, for example.The Buddhist traditions present a multitude of Buddhist paths to liberation, and Buddhist thinkers in India and subsequently in East Asia have covered topics as varied as phenomenology, ethics, ontology, epistemology, logic and philosophy of time in their analysis of these paths.Early Buddhism was based on empirical evidence gained by the sense organs (ayatana)Particular points of Buddhist philosophy have often been the subject of disputes between different schools of Buddhism.The idea that "this cosmos is the self" is one of the views rejected by the Buddha The Buddha also held that understanding and seeing the truth of not-self led to un-attachment, and hence to the cessation of suffering, while ignorance about the true nature of personality led to further suffering.All schools of Indian philosophy recognize various sets of valid justifications for knowledge, or pramana and many see the Vedas as providing access to truth.The Buddha, however, realized that the mind was embodied and causally dependent on the body, and therefore that a malnourished body did not allow the mind to be trained and developed.Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout these early texts, so older studies by various scholars conclude that the Buddha must at least have taught some of these key teachings:According to N. Ross Reat, all of these doctrines are shared by the Theravada Pali texts and the Mahasamghika school's xc5x9axc4x81listamba Sxc5xabtra.However, some scholars such as Schmithausen, Vetter, and Bronkhorst argue that critical analysis reveals discrepancies among these various doctrines.The Buddha also stressed that experience is the only criterion for verification of the truth in this passage from the Majjhima Nikaya (MN.I.265):Furthermore, the Buddha's standard for personal verification was a pragmatic and salvific one, for the Buddha a belief counts as truth only if it leads to successful Buddhist practice (and hence, to the destruction of craving).The Prajxc3xb1xc4x81pxc4x81ramitxc4x81 is said to be true knowledge of the nature of ultimate reality, which is illusory and empty of essence.The Diamond Sutra states that: The Heart Sutra famously affirms the shunyata of phenomena:Form is shunyata and shunyata is form;<br />the same is true for feelings,<br />perceptions, volitions and consciousness".</blockquote>The Prajxc3xb1xc4x81pxc4x81ramitxc4x81 teachings are associated with the work of the Buddhist philosopher Nxc4x81gxc4x81rjuna (c. 150 xe2x80x93 c. 250 CE) and the Madhyamaka (Middle way) school. </my-abstract>

<title>BIOS</title>
<wiki-abstract> BIOS (, ; an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first software to run when powered on. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> A boot menu such as the textual menu of Windows, which allows users to choose an operating system to boot, to boot into the safe mode, or to use the last known good configuration, is displayed through BIOS and receives keyboard input through BIOS.Most modern PCs can still boot and run legacy operating systems such as MS-DOS or DR-DOS that rely heavily on BIOS for their console and disk I/O, providing that the system has a BIOS or BIOS-compatible firmware, which is not necessarily the case with UEFI-based PCs.Intel processors have reprogrammable microcode since the P6 microarchitecture.Modern BIOS (UEFI) includes Intel Management Engine, AMD Platform Security Processor and Onboard Video BIOS firmwares.Some BIOSes contain a software licensing description table (SLIC), a digital signature placed inside the BIOS by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), for example Dell.Anyone who could switch on the computer could boot it.Later, 386-class computers started integrating the BIOS setup utility in the ROM itself, alongside the BIOS code; these computers usually boot into the BIOS setup utility if a certain key or key combination is pressed, otherwise the BIOS POST and boot process are executed.A modern BIOS setup utility has a menu-based user interface (UI) accessed by pressing a certain key on the keyboard when the PC starts.Before the BIOS Boot Specification was promulgated, this was the only way for expansion ROMs to implement boot capability for devices not supported for booting by the native BIOS of the motherboard.After the motherboard BIOS completes its POST, most BIOS versions search for option ROM modules, also called BIOS extension ROMs, and execute them.b'      DESCRIPTION: Firmware.BIOS (, ; an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs.Most BIOS implementations are specifically designed to work with a particular computer or motherboard model, by interfacing with various devices that make up the complementary system chipset.Together with the underlying hardware-specific but operating system-independent "System BIOS", which resides in ROM, it represents the analogue to the "CP/M BIOS".The BIOS originally proprietary to the IBM PC has been reverse engineered by some companies (such as Phoenix Technologies) looking to create compatible systems.With the introduction of PS/2 machines, IBM divided the System BIOS into real- and protected-mode portions. </my-abstract>

<title>Bose–Einstein condensate</title>
<wiki-abstract> In condensed matter physics, a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter (also called the fifth state of matter) which is typically formed when a gas of bosons at low densities is cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero (-273.15 °C) (-459. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> For a system of this nature, <math>|psi(vec{r})|^2</math> is interpreted as the particle density, so the total number of atoms is <math>N=int dvec{r}|psi(vec{r})|^2</math>Provided essentially all atoms are in the condensate (that is, have condensed to the ground state), and treating the bosons using mean field theory, the energy (E) associated with the state <math>psi(vec{r})</math> is:dvec{r}left[frac{hbar^2}{2m}|ablapsi(vec{r})|^2+V(vec{r})|psi(vec{r})|^2+frac{1}{2}U_0|psi(vec{r})|^4right]</math>Minimizing this energy with respect to infinitesimal variations in <math>psi(vec{r})</math>, and holding the number of atoms constant, yields the Grossxe2x80x93Pitaevski equation (GPE) (also a non-linear Schrxc3xb6dinger equation):where:In the case of zero external potential, the dispersion law  of interacting Bosexe2x80x93Einstein-condensed particles is given by so-called Bogoliubov spectrum (for <math> T= 0</math>):The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) provides a relatively good description of the behavior of atomic BEC's.Whether any particular particle is in state <math>scriptstyle|0rangle</math> or in state <math>scriptstyle|1rangle</math> cannot be determined, so each value of K determines a unique quantum state for the whole system.Suppose now that the energy of state <math>scriptstyle|1rangle</math> is slightly greater than the energy of state <math>scriptstyle|0rangle</math> by an amount E. At temperature T, a particle will have a lesser probability to be in state <math>scriptstyle|1rangle</math> by <math>e^{-E/kT}</math>.It is noticeable that <math>g_{3/2}</math> is a monotonically growing function of <math>f</math> in <math>f in [0, 1]</math>, which are the only values for which the series converge.Recognizing that the second term on the right-hand side contains the expression for the average occupation number of the fundamental state <math>langle n_0 rangle</math>, the equation of state can be rewritten asBecause the left term on the second equation must always be positive, <math>frac{lambda^3}{v}>g_{3/2}(f)</math> and because <math>g_{3/2}(f)le g_{3/2}(1)</math>, a stronger condition iswhich defines a transition between a gas phase and a condensed phase.This is usually done computationally, however, in a uniform medium, the following analytic form demonstrates the correct behavior, and is a good approximation:Here, <math>n</math> is the density far from the vortex and <math>x=rho/(ell xi)</math>, where <math>xi=1/sqrt{8pi a_s n_0}</math> is the healing length of the condensate.A singly charged vortex (<math>ell=1</math>) is in the ground state, with its energy <math>epsilon_v</math> given byfrac{hbar^2}{m}lnleft(1.464frac{b}{xi}right)</math>where <math>,b</math>& is& the farthest distance from the vortices considered.These early studies founded the field of ultracold atoms, and hundreds of research groups around the world now routinely produce BECs of dilute atomic vapors in their labs.Since 1995, many other atomic species have been condensed, and BECs have also been realized using molecules, quasi-particles, and photons.This transition to BEC occurs below a critical temperature, which for a uniform three-dimensional gas consisting of non-interacting particles with no apparent internal degrees of freedom is given by:where:Interactions shift the value and the corrections can be calculated by mean-field theory.This formula is derived from finding the gas degeneracy in the Bose gas using Bosexe2x80x93Einstein statistics.For an ideal Bose gas we have the equation of state:where <math>v=frac{V}{N}</math> is the per particle volume, <math>lambda</math> the thermal wavelength, <math>f</math> the fugacity and <math>g_alpha (f)=sum limits_{n=1}^infty frac{f^n}{n^alpha}</math>. </my-abstract>

<title>Beer–Lambert law</title>
<wiki-abstract> The Beer–Lambert law, also known as Beer's law, the Lambert–Beer law, or the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law relates the attenuation of light to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling. The law is commonly applied to chemical analysis measurements and used in understanding attenuation in physical optics, for photons, neutrons, or rarefied gases. </wiki-abstract>

reworked arrangement of "Help Me, Rhonda" which became the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965.To appease Capitol's demands for a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, Brian conceived Beach Boys' Party!, a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are a-Changin'", and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier songs.In December, Brian was released from Landy's program due to disputes over Landy's fee.From late 1976 to early 1977, Brian made sporadic public appearances and produced the band's next album, The Beach Boys Love You, a collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced alone.It went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.Responding to a new European Union copyright law that extended copyright to 70 years for recordings that were published within 50 years after they were made, Capitol began issuing annual 50-year anniversary "copyright extension" releases of Beach Boys recordings, starting with The Big Beat 1963 (2013).Jardine, Marks, Johnston and Love appeared together at the 2014 Ella Awards Ceremony, where Love was honored for his work as a singer.In 2016, Love and Wilson published memoirs, Good Vibrations: My Life as a Beach Boy and I Am Brian Wilson, respectively.The impetus had shifted from recording new material to large venue touring, and under Guercio, the Beach Boys staged a successful 1975 joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's single "Wishing You Were Here".In 1968, the group's interest in transcendental meditation led them to record the original song, "Transcendental Meditation".The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, The group's early songs made them major pop stars in the US, the UK, Australia and other countries, having seven top 10 singles between April 1963 and November 1964.The Beach Boys Love You is sometimes considered the group's "punk album",In the 1990s, the Beach Boys experienced a resurgence of popularity with the alternative rock generation., Brian and Jardine do not perform with Love's Beach Boys, but remain official members of the band.The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful bands of all time, with over 100 million records sold worldwide. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In September 1966, the Welsh Liberal Party formed their own state party, moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structure.In local elections, Liverpool remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the elections to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973.The Conservative Party under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election, placing the Labour Party back in opposition, which served to push the Liberals back into the margins.In 1981, defectors from a moderate faction of the Labour Party, led by former Cabinet ministers Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, founded the Social Democratic Party (SDP).[...] It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do, what they shall think, what they shall drink, when they shall go to bed, what they shall buy, and where they shall buy it, what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them, against which the Liberal party have always protested.</blockquote>The political terms of "modern", "progressive" or "new" Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice.By the early 20th century, the Liberals stance began to shift towards "New Liberalism", what would today be called social liberalism, namely a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of welfare.David Lloyd George adopted a programme at the 1929 general election entitled We Can Conquer Unemployment!, although by this stage the Liberals had declined to third-party status.Meadowcroft joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007, but the Liberal Party as reconstituted in 1989 continues to hold council seats and field candidates in Westminster Parliamentary elections.During the 19th century, the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called classical liberalism, supporting laissez-faire economic policies such as free trade and minimal government interference in the economy (this doctrine was usually termed Gladstonian liberalism after the Victorian era Liberal prime minister William Ewart Gladstone).The leading Liberal newspaper, the Manchester Guardian complained:, p. 59.</ref> shows that following success as the successor to the Whig party, the party's share of the popular vote plummeted after the First World War as it lost votes to the new Labour party and fractured into groups such as the National and Coalition Liberals]]Labour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base interest rate, which is decided by the Monetary Policy Committee, and through its communications strategy, such as publishing yield curves.The Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:The 1997 memorandum of understanding describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability.The Bank acts as the government's banker, and it maintains the government's Consolidated Fund account.The road junction outside is known as Bank junction.As a regulator and central bank, the Bank of England has not offered consumer banking services for many years, but it still does manage some public-facing services such as exchanging superseded bank notes.To induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. </my-abstract>

Seabury of the Boonton Rubber Company.By 1930, designer Paul T. Frankl considered Bakelite a "Materia Nova", "expressive of our own age".The British children's construction toy Bayko, launched in 1933, originally used Bakelite for many of its parts, and took its name from the material.During World War II, Bakelite was used in a variety of wartime equipment including pilot's goggles and field telephones.In 1947, Dutch art forger Han van Meegeren was convicted of forgery, after chemist and curator Paul B. Coremans proved that a purported Vermeer contained Bakelite, which van Meegeren had used as a paint hardener.Bakelite was sometimes used as a substitute for metal in the magazine, pistol grip, fore grip, hand guard, and butt stock of firearms. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> When male lactation occurs, it is considered a symptom of a disorder of the pituitary gland.Plastic surgery can be performed to augment or reduce the size of breasts, or reconstruct the breast in cases of deformative disease, such as breast cancer.In cases where a woman's breasts are severely asymmetrical, surgery can be performed to either enlarge the smaller breast, reduce the size of the larger breast, or both.Breast augmentation surgery generally does not interfere with future ability to breastfeed.Breasts, especially the nipples, are an erogenous zone.The English word breast derives from the Old English word brxc4x93ost (breast, bosom) from Proto-Germanic breustam (breast), from the Proto-Indo-European base bhreusxe2x80x93 (to swell, to sprout).]]In women, the breasts overlie the pectoralis major muscles and usually extend from the level of the second rib to the level of the sixth rib in the front of the human rib cage; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls.Normal breast tissue typically has a texture that feels nodular or granular, to an extent that varies considerably from woman to woman. The study The Evolution of the Human Breast (2001) proposed that the rounded shape of a woman's breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat; that is, because of the human infant's small jaw, which did not project from the face to reach the nipple, he or she might block the nostrils against the mother's breast if it were of a flatter form (cf. </my-abstract>

<title>Biotechnology</title>
<wiki-abstract> Biotechnology is a broad area of biology, involving the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products. Depending on the tools and applications, it often overlaps with related scientific fields. </wiki-abstract>

<headings> Definition , History , Medicine , Agriculture , 
Industrial biotechnology (known mainly in Europe as white biotechnology) is the application of biotechnology for industrial purposes, including industrial fermentation. It includes the practice of using cells such as microorganisms, or components of cells like enzymes, to generate industrially useful products in sectors such as chemicals, food and feed, detergents, paper and pulp, textiles and biofuels.
 , 
The environment can be affected by biotechnologies, both positively and adversely. Vallero and others have argued that the difference between beneficial biotechnology (e.g.bioremediation is to clean up an oil spill or hazard chemical leak) versus the adverse effects stemming from biotechnological enterprises (e.g. flow of genetic material from transgenic organisms into wild strains) can be seen as applications and implications, respectively. Cleaning up environmental wastes is an example of an application of environmental biotechnology; whereas loss of biodiversity or loss of containment of a harmful microbe are examples of environmental implications of biotechnology.
 , 
The regulation of genetic engineering concerns approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of genetic engineering technology, and the development and release of genetically modified organisms (GMO), including genetically modified crops and genetically modified fish. There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe.
 , 
In 1988, after prompting from the United States Congress, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (National Institutes of Health) (NIGMS) instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training. Universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish Biotechnology Training Programs (BTPs). Each successful application is generally funded for five years then must be competitively renewed. Graduate students in turn compete for acceptance into a BTP; if accepted, then stipend, tuition and health insurance support is provided for two or three years during the course of their Ph.D. thesis work. Nineteen institutions offer NIGMS supported BTPs.

<my-abstract> The ISFET is widely used in biomedical applications, such as the detection of DNA hybridization, biomarker detection from blood, antibody detection, glucose measurement, pH sensing, and genetic technology.By the mid-1980s, other BioFETs had been developed, including the gas sensor FET (GASFET), pressure sensor FET (PRESSFET), chemical field-effect transistor (ChemFET), reference ISFET (REFET), enzyme-modified FET (ENFET) and immunologically modified FET (IMFET).A factor influencing the biotechnology sector's success is improved intellectual property rights legislationxe2x80x94and enforcementxe2x80x94worldwide, as well as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an ageing, and ailing, U.S. population.Rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology sector, with the Department of Energy estimating ethanol usage could reduce U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The insect stops eating within a few hours and eventually starves.In 1996, the first GM maize producing a Bt Cry protein was approved, which killed the European corn borer and related species; subsequent Bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae.Approved Bt genes include single and stacked (event names bracketed) configurations of: Cry1A.105 (MON89034), CryIAb (MON810), CryIF (1507), Cry2Ab (MON89034), Cry3Bb1 (MON863 and MON88017), Cry34Ab1 (59122), Cry35Ab1 (59122), mCry3A (MIR604), and Vip3A (MIR162), in both corn and cotton.In 2018 a study found that Bt-corn protected nearby fields of non-Bt corn and nearby vegetable crops, reducing the use of pesticides on those crops.They tolerate the use of Roundup.The European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, destroys corn crops by burrowing into the stem, causing the plant to fall over.Bt corn is a variant of maize that has been genetically altered to express one or more proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensisIn recent years, traits have been added to ward off corn ear worms and root worms, the latter of which annually causes about a billion dollars in damages.The Bt protein is expressed throughout the plant. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> He made a lasting contribution to the literature for younger students: for his son Pxc3xa9ter's music lessons, he composed Mikrokosmos, a six-volume collection of graded piano pieces.Paul Wilson lists as the most prominent characteristics of Bartxc3xb3k's music from late 1920s onwards the influence of the Carpathian basin and European art music, and his changing attitude toward (and use of) tonality, but without the use of the traditional harmonic functions associated with major and minor scales.Although Bartxc3xb3k claimed in his writings that his music was always tonal, he rarely uses the chords or scales of tonality, and so the descriptive resources of tonal theory are of limited use.In his search for new forms of tonality, Bartxc3xb3k turned to Hungarian folk music, as well as to other folk music of the Carpathian Basin and even of Algeria and Turkey; in so doing he became influential in that stream of modernism which exploited indigenous music and techniques.One characteristic style of music is his Night music, which he used mostly in slow movements of multi-movement ensemble or orchestral compositions in his mature period.Compilations of Bartxc3xb3k's field recordings, interviews, and original piano playing have been released over the years, largely by the Hungarian record label Hungaroton:A compilation of field recordings and transcriptions for two violas was also recently released by Tantara Records in 2014.On 18 March 2016 Decca Classics released Bxc3xa9la Bartxc3xb3k: The Complete Works, the first ever complete compilation of all of Bartxc3xb3k's compositions, including new recordings of never-before-recorded early piano and vocal works. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> In particular the outer product <math>|psiranglelanglephi| </math> of a column and a row vector ket and bra can be identified with matrix multiplication (column vector times  row vector equals matrix).For a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed orthonormal basis, the inner product can be written as a matrix multiplication of a row vector with a column vector:begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & cdots & A_N^* end{pmatrix}begin{pmatrix} B_1  B_2  vdots  B_N end{pmatrix}</math>Based on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:and then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies matrix multiplication.The conjugate transpose (also called Hermitian conjugate) of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:because if one starts with the brathen performs a complex conjugation, and then a matrix transpose, one ends up with the ketWriting elements of a finite dimensional (or mutatis mutandis, countably infinite) vector space as  a column vector of numbers requires picking a basis.This is written in various notations:See quantum entanglement and the EPR paradox for applications of this product.Consider a complete orthonormal system (basis),for a Hilbert space , with respect to the norm from an inner product }}.From basic functional analysis, it is  known that any ket <math>|psirangle </math> can also be written aswith }} the inner product on the Hilbert space.From the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars, it follows thatmust be the identity operator, which sends each vector to itself.This, then,  can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value;

<title>BDSM</title>
<wiki-abstract> BDSM is a variety of often erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage, discipline, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other related interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves to be practising BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture often is said to depend on self-identification and shared experience. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The philosopher Edmund Burke called the sensation of pleasure derived from pain "sublime".In some BDSM sessions, the top exposes the bottom to a range of sensual experiences, such as pinching; biting; scratching with fingernails; erotic spanking; erotic electrostimulation; and the use of crops, whips, liquid wax, ice cubes, and Wartenberg wheels.Following are some of the types of BDSM play:Aside from the general advice related to safe sex, BDSM sessions often require a wider array of safety precautions than vanilla sex (sexual behaviour without BDSM elements).Safewords are words or phrases that are called out when things are either not going as planned or have crossed a threshold one cannot handle.Nevertheless, a purist "school" exists within the BDSM community, which regards such "topping from the bottom" as rude or even incompatible with the standards of BDSM relations.;Long termEarly writings on BDSM both by the academic and BDSM community spoke little of long-term relationships with some in the gay leather community suggesting short-term play relationships to be the only feasible relationship models, and recommending people to get married and "play" with BDSM outside of marriage.They are three separate items, that are normally associated together.The BDSM rights flag, shown to the right, is intended to represent the belief that people whose sexuality or relationship preferences include BDSM practises deserve the same human rights as everyone else, and should not be discriminated against for pursuing BDSM with consenting adults.The flag is inspired by the leather pride flag and BDSM emblem but is specifically intended to represent the concept of BDSM rights and to be without the other symbols' restrictions against commercial use.In recent times though writers of BDSM and sites for BDSM have been more focused on long-term relationships.A 2003 study, the first to look at these relationships, fully demonstrated that "quality long-term functioning relationships" exist among practitioners of BDSM, with either sex being the top or bottom (the study was based on 17 heterosexual couples).Amongst the respondents, it was typically the bottoms who wanted to play harder, and be more restricted into their roles when there was a difference in desire to play in the relationship.Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies.A representative study done from 2001 to 2002 in Australia found that 1.8% of sexually active people (2.2% men, 1.3% women but no significant sex difference) had engaged in BDSM activity in the previous year.The figures were 62 and 52% for bondage fantasies, and 14 to 23% for bondage behaviors.Reflecting changes in social norms, modern medical opinion is now moving away from regarding BDSM activities as medical disorders, unless they are nonconsensual or involve significant distress or harm.In the past, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the American Psychiatric Association's manual, defined some BDSM activities as sexual disorders.The World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has made similar moves in recent years.Section F65 of the current revision, ICD-10, indicates that "mild degrees of sadomasochistic stimulation are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity".The author of the study, Bert Cutler, speculated that tops may be less often in the mood to play due to the increased demand for responsibility on their part: being aware of the safety of the situation and prepared to remove the bottom from a dangerous scenario, being conscious of the desires and limits of the bottom, and so on.Many of those engaged in long-term BDSM relationships learned their skills from larger BDSM organizations and communities.Couples were generally of the same mind of whether or not they were in an ongoing relationship, but in such cases, the bottom was not locked up constantly, but that their role in the context of the relationship was always present, even when the top was doing non-dominant activities such as household chores, or the bottom being in a more dominant position. </my-abstract>

<title>Blizzard</title>
<wiki-abstract> A blizzard is a severe snowstorm characterized by strong sustained winds of at least  and lasting for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more. A ground blizzard is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> The term became common in the press during the harsh winter of 1880xe2x80x9381.In the United States, storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the jet stream dips far to the south, allowing cold, dry polar air from the north to clash with warm, humid air moving up from the south.When cold, moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward to the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, and warmer, moist air moves north from the Gulf of Mexico, all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the Texas Panhandle to the Great Lakes and Midwest.The primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time, but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface.The Australia Bureau of Meteorology describes a blizzard as, "Violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow, some part, at least, of which has been raised from snow covered ground. </my-abstract>

<title>Bikini</title>
<wiki-abstract> A bikini is typically a women's two-piece swimsuit featuring two triangles of fabric on top that cover the woman's breasts, similar to a bra, and two triangles of fabric on the bottom: the front covering the pelvis but exposing the navel, and the back covering the buttocks. The size of the top and bottom can vary, from bikinis that offer full coverage of the breasts, pelvis, and buttocks, to more revealing designs with a thong or G-string bottom that covers only the mons pubis, but exposes the buttocks, and a top that covers little more than the areolae. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> "In a single fashion show in 1985, there were two-piece suits with cropped tank tops instead of the usual skimpy bandeaux, suits that resembled bikinis from the front and one-pieces from the back, suspender straps, ruffles, and deep navel-baring cutouts.There is a range of distinct bikini styles available xe2x80x94 string bikinis, monokinis (topless or top and bottom connected), Trikinis (three pieces instead of two), tankinis (tank top, bikini bottom), camikinis (camisole top, bikini bottom), bandeaukini (bandeau top, bikini bottom), skirtini (bikini top, skirt bottom), "granny bikini" (bikini top, boy shorts bottom),  (also ), seekinis (transparent), minikinis, microkinis, miniminis, slingshots (or suspender bikinis), thong bottoms, tie-sides (a variety of string bikini) and teardrops.Bikinis have become a major component of marketing various women's sports.In 1994, the bikini became the official uniform of women's Olympic beach volleyball.Male punk rock musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs.Male bikini tops also exist and are often used as visual gags.Depending on the style of bikini-bottom and the amount of skin visible outside the bikini,The tan lines created by the wearing of a bikini while tanning are known as a bikini tan.It became one of the most famous bikinis of all time and an iconic moment in cinematic and fashion history.The bikini finally caught on, and by 1963, the movie Beach Party, starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol, though Funicello was barred from wearing Rxc3xa9ard's bikini unlike the other young females in the films.The size of the top and bottom can vary, from bikinis that offer full coverage of the breasts, pelvis, and buttocks, to more revealing designs with a thong or G-string bottom that covers only the mons pubis, but exposes the buttocks, and a top that covers little more than the areolae.In May 1946, Parisian fashion designer Jacques Heim released a two-piece swimsuit design that he named the  ('Atom') and advertised as "the smallest swimsuit in the world".Due to its controversial and revealing design, the bikini was accepted very slowly by the public. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> On receiving news that Rana Sanga had made preparations to renew the conflict with him, Babur decided to isolate the Rana by inflicting a military defeat on one of his staunchest allies, Medini Rai, who was the ruler of Malwa.Upon reaching Chanderi, on 20 January 1528, Babur offered Shamsabad to Medini Rao in exchange for Chanderi as a peace overture, but the offer was rejected.Babur defeated and killed Ibrahim Lodi, the last Sultan of the Lodi dynasty, in 1526.He was first buried in Agra but, as per his wishes, his mortal remains were moved to Kabul and reburied in Bagh-e Babur in Kabul sometime between 1539xe2x80x931544.It is generally agreed that, as a Timurid, Babur was not only significantly influenced by the Persian culture, but also that his empire gave rise to the expansion of the Persianate ethos in the Indian subcontinent.For example, F. Lehmann states in the Encyclopxc3xa6dia Iranica:In his own words, "The cream of my testimony is this, do nothing against your brothers even though they may deserve it." </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Although the councils of xc3x89tampes, Wxc3xbcrzburg, Clermont, and Rheims all supported Innocent, large portions of the Christian world still supported Anacletus.In a letter by Bernard to German Emperor Lothair regarding Antipope Anacletus, Bernard wrote, xe2x80x9cIt is a disgrace for Christ that a Jew sits on the throne of St. Peterxe2x80x99s.xe2x80x9d and xe2x80x9cAnacletus has not even a good reputation with his friends, while Innocent is illustrious beyond all doubt.xe2x80x9dBernard wrote to Gerard of Angoulxc3xaame (a letter known as Letter 126), which questioned Gerard's reasons for supporting Anacletus.His two successors, Pope Celestine II and Pope Lucius II, reigned only a short time, and then Bernard saw one of his disciples, Bernard of Pisa, and known thereafter as Eugene III, raised to the Chair of Saint Peter.Dante's choice appears to be based on Bernard's contemplative mysticism, his devotion to Mary, and his reputation for eloquence.The Couvent et Basilique Saint-Bernard, a collection of buildings dating from the 12th, 17th and 19th centuries, is dedicated to Bernard and stands in his birthplace of Fontaine-lxc3xa8s-Dijon.Bernard of Clairvaux is the attributed author of poems often translated in English hymnals as:The modern critical edition is  (1957xe2x80x931977), edited by Jean Leclercq..}}Bernard's works include: Many letters, treatises, and other works, falsely attributed to him survive, and are now referred to as works by pseudo-Bernard. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The German battleships carried five or six underwater torpedo tubes in three sizes from 18 to 21 inch and the battlecruisers carried four or five tubes.The German battle fleet was hampered by the slow speed and relatively poor armament of the six pre-dreadnoughts of II Squadron, which limited maximum fleet speed to , compared to maximum British fleet speed of .U-66 was also supposed to be patrolling off the Firth of Forth but had been forced north to a position  off Peterhead by patrolling British vessels.The battle unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and three main engagements (the battlecruiser action, the fleet action and the night action), from 31 May to 1 June 1916, off the North Sea coast of Denmark's Jutland Peninsula.Germany's High Seas Fleet intended to lure out, trap, and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, as the German naval force was insufficient to openly engage the entire British fleet.This time his arc of fire was tighter and deadlier, causing severe damage to the German battleships, particularly Rear-Admiral Behncke's leading 3rd Squadron (SMS Kxc3xb6nig, , Markgraf, and  all being hit, along with  of the 1st Squadron), the very few radio reports that were sent to the British flagship were never received, possibly because the Germans were jamming British frequencies..]]From 23:20 to approximately 02:15, several British destroyer flotillas launched torpedo attacks on the German battle fleet in a series of violent and chaotic engagements at extremely short range (often under ).Deploying to the east would take the force away from Scheer, but Jellicoe's ships might be able to cross the "T", and visibility would strongly favour British gunnery xe2x80x93 Scheer's forces would be silhouetted against the setting sun to the west, while the Grand Fleet would be indistinct against the dark skies to the north and east, and would be hidden by reflection of the low sunlight off intervening haze and smoke.After the turn, the 5th Battle Squadron was now leading the British ships in the westernmost column, and Beatty's squadron was centre and rearmost, with the 2nd BCS to the west.At 14:20 on 31 May, despite heavy haze and scuds of fog giving poor visibility,Beatty began to move his battlecruisers and supporting forces south-eastwards and then east to cut the German ships off from their base and ordered Engadine to launch a seaplane to try to get more information about the size and location of the German forces. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> It is covered with glass curtain walls.While its distinctive look makes it one of Hong Kong's most identifiable landmarks today, it was the source of some controversy at one time, as the bank is the only major building in Hong Kong to have bypassed the convention of consulting with feng shui masters on matters of design prior to construction.The building has been criticised by some practitioners of feng shui for its sharp edges and its negative symbolism by the numerous 'X' shapes in its original design, though Pei modified the design to some degree before construction following this feedback. </my-abstract>

<wiki-abstract> 貘}} are Japanese supernatural beings that are said to devour nightmares. According to legend, they were created by the spare pieces that were left over when the gods finished creating all other animals. </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> In recent years, there have been changes in how the baku is depicted.The traditional Japanese nightmare-devouring baku originates in Chinese folklore about the mo xe8xb2x98 and was familiar in Japan as early as the Muromachi period (14thxe2x80x9315th century).An early 17th-century Japanese manuscript, the Sankai Ibutsu (), describes the baku as a shy, Chinese mythical chimera with an elephantxe2x80x99s trunk, rhinoceros' eyes, an ox's tail, and a tiger's paws, which protected against pestilence and evil, although eating nightmares was not included among its abilities.Writing in the Meiji period, Lafcadio Hearn (1902) described a baku with very similar attributes that was also able to devour nightmares.Legend has it that a person who wakes up from a bad dream can call out to baku. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Teach and Vane spent several nights on the southern tip of Ocracoke Island, accompanied by such notorious figures as Israel Hands, Robert Deal and Calico Jack.As it spread throughout the neighbouring colonies, the news of Teach and Vane's impromptu party worried the Governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates.Spotswood learnt that William Howard, the former quartermaster of Queen Anne's Revenge, was in the area, and believing that he might know of Teach's whereabouts had the pirate and his two slaves arrested.Teach's corpse was thrown into the inlet and his head was suspended from the bowsprit of Maynard's sloop so that the reward could be collected.Lieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days, making repairs and burying the dead.The remainder of Teach's crew and former associates were found by Brand, in Bath,Governor Eden was certainly embarrassed by Spotswood's invasion of North Carolina,Eden was annoyed that the accusations against Knight arose during a trial in which he played no part.Teach thought that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited to see what would happen to another captain.The author Robert Lee surmised that Teach and Hands intentionally ran the ships aground to reduce the fleet's crew complement, increasing their share of the spoils. </my-abstract>

<title>Ballad</title>
<wiki-abstract> A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French chanson balladée or ballade, which were originally "dance songs". </wiki-abstract>

<my-abstract> For the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term 'ballad' to mean a slow love song.The traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering minstrels of late medieval Europe.Early collections of English ballads were made by Samuel Pepys (1633xe2x80x931703) and in the Roxburghe Ballads collected by Robert Harley, (1661&ndash;1724), which paralleled the work in Scotland by Walter Scott and Robert Burns.Both Northern English and Southern Scots shared in the identified tradition of Border ballads, particularly evinced by the cross-border narrative in versions of "The Ballad of Chevy Chase" sometimes associated with the Lancashire-born sixteenth-century minstrel Richard Sheale.It has been suggested that the increasing interest in traditional popular ballads during the eighteenth century was prompted by social issues such as the enclosure movement as many of the ballads deal with themes concerning rural laborers.Key work on the traditional ballad was undertaken in the late 19th century in Denmark by Svend Grundtvig and for England and Scotland by the Harvard professor Francis James Child.Broadside ballads (also known as 'broadsheet', 'stall', 'vulgar' or 'come all ye' ballads) were a product of the development of cheap print in the 16th century.Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period.The first, most important and successful was The Beggar's Opera of 1728, with a libretto by John Gay and music arranged by John Christopher Pepusch, both of whom probably influenced by Parisian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of Thomas d'Urfey (1653xe2x80x931723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work.In the 20th century, one of the most influential plays, Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht's (1928) The Threepenny Opera was a reworking of The Beggar's Opera, setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite, but only using one tune from the original.Some 300 ballads sung in North America have been identified as having origins in British traditional or broadside ballads. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The span of nineteen years between Curse of the Hidden Mirror and The Symbol Remains marks the longest gap between studio albums in Blue xc3x96yster Cult's career.Blue xc3x96yster Cult is a hard rock band, whose music has been described as heavy metal, and Black Sabbath.While Blue xc3x96yster Cult has been noted for heavy rock, they would often add their own tongue-in-cheek style.In a 1976 interview published in the U.K. music magazine ZigZag, Pearlman told the story explaining the origin of the band's name was an anagram of "Cully Stout Beer".The addition of an umlaut was suggested by Allen Lanier, but rock critic Richard Meltzer claims to have suggested it just after Pearlman came up with the name, reportedly "because of the Wagnerian aspect of Metal".The hook-and-cross logo was designed by Bill Gawlik The logo's "... metaphysical, alchemical and mythological connotations, combined with its similarity to some religious symbols gave it a flair of decadence and mystery ..."The band was billed, for the only time, as "The Blue xc3x96yster Cult" on the cover and label of their second album, Tyranny and Mutation.Blue xc3x96yster Cult have been influential to the realm of hard rock and heavy metal, leading them to being referred to as xe2x80x9cthe thinking manxe2x80x99s heavy metal bandxe2x80x9d due to their often cryptic lyrics, literate songwriting, and links to famous authors.The band's influence has extended beyond the musical sphere.The band's music videos, especially "Burnin' for You," received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern popular culture.Blue xc3x96yster Cult's longest-lasting and most commercially successful lineup included Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser (lead guitar, vocals), Eric Bloom (lead vocals, "stun guitar"), Allen Lanier (keyboards, rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Joe Bouchard (bass, vocals), and Albert Bouchard (drums, percussion, vocals).Sarzo then joined as an official member of the band, although Rogers continued to occasionally fill in when Sarzo was busy.In February 2007, the Sony Legacy remaster series continued, releasing expanded versions of studio album Spectres and live album Some Enchanted Evening.In June 2012, the band announced that bassist Rudy Sarzo was leaving the band and was being replaced by former Utopia bassist Kasim Sulton.In August of the same year, it was announced that Sony Legacy would be releasing a 17-disc boxed set entitled The Complete Columbia Albums Collection on October 30, 2012. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Some practitioners claim that BV can be asymptomatic in almost half of affected women,Although previously considered a mere nuisance infection, untreated bacterial vaginosis may cause increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and pregnancy complications.It has been shown that HIV-infected women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) are more likely to transmit HIV to their sexual partners than those without BV.There is evidence of an association between BV and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS.In addition, bacterial vaginosis as either pre-existing, or acquired,  may increase the risk of pregnancy complications, most notably premature birth or miscarriage.Pregnant women with BV have a higher risk of chorioamnionitis, miscarriage, preterm birth,  premature rupture of membranes, and postpartum endometritis.Healthy vaginal microbiota consists of species which neither cause symptoms or infections, nor negatively affect pregnancy.It also found that such treatment may lead treated sexual partners to report increased adverse events.Treatment is typically with the antibiotics metronidazole or clindamycin.Other antibiotics that may work include macrolides, lincosamides, nitroimidazoles, and penicillins.Bacterial vaginosis is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, and treatment of a male sexual partner of a woman with bacterial vaginosis is not recommended. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Selig's defenders point to the poor management of the team after Selig-Prieb took control as proof that Selig was not working behind the scenes.Selig was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001.On August 24, 2010, a statue of Selig, the Selig Monument, commissioned by Brewers owner Mark Attanasio and designed by artist Brian Maughan, was unveiled outside Miller Park in Milwaukee.Selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of Commissioner Fay Vincent, and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal.More specifically in regards to the Mets, critics point out that with Selig's personal relationship with Wilpon has motivated him to stall any possible removal of Wilpon as that club's principal owner.Selig also notably failed to resolve a 6-year conflict between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics regarding the Athletics' proposed move to San Jose.In May 2015, the Milwaukee Brewers honored Bud Selig with the unveiling of the Selig Experience exhibit at Miller Park. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> The European bison, B. bonasus, or wisent, is found in Europe and the Caucasus, reintroduced after being extinct in the wild.While all bison species are classified in their own genus, they are sometimes bred with domestic cattle (genus Bos) and produce sometimes fertile offspring called beefalo or zubron.The American bison and the European bison (wisent) are the largest surviving terrestrial animals in North America and Europe.This crossbreeding was not sufficient to conflate the different species back together, but it has resulted in unexpected relationships between many members of this group, such as yak being related to American bison, when such relationships would otherwise not be apparent.A 2003 study of mitochondrial DNA indicated four distinct maternal lineages in tribe Bovini:# Taurine cattle and zebu# Wisent# American bison and yak and# Banteng, gaur, and gayalHowever, Y chromosome analysis associated wisent and American bison.The genus Bison diverged from the lineage that led to cattle (Bos primigenius) at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary in South Asia.The sixth, B. palaeosinensis, evolving in the Early Pleistocene in South Asia,At one point, some steppe bison crossbred with the ancestors of the modern yak. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Such particle types are said to have negative or odd parity (P& =& xe2x88x921, or alternatively P& =& xe2x80x93), while the other particles are said to have positive or even parity (P& =& +1, or alternatively P& =& +).For baryons, the parity is related to the orbital angular momentum by the relation:As a consequence, baryons with no orbital angular momentum (L& =& 0) all have even parity (P& =& +).Baryons are classified into groups according to their isospin (I) values and quark (q) content.They are related to the number of strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks and antiquark according to the relations:         S &= -left(n_mathrm{s} - n_mathrm{bar{s}}right),          C &= +left(n_mathrm{c} - n_mathrm{bar{c}}right),   B^prime &= -left(n_mathrm{b} - n_mathrm{bar{b}}right),          T &= +left(n_mathrm{t} - n_mathrm{bar{t}}right),end{align}</math>meaning that the Gell-Mannxe2x80x93Nishijima formula is equivalent to the expression of charge in terms of quark content:Spin (quantum number S) is a vector quantity that represents the "intrinsic" angular momentum of a particle. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> However, the round function is applied to the difference between the two, and the result is then added to both half blocks.Let <math>mathrm F</math> be the round function and <math>mathrm H</math> a half-round function and let <math>K_0,K_1,ldots,K_n</math> be the sub-keys for the rounds <math>0,1,ldots,n</math> respectively.Then the basic operation is as follows:Split the plaintext block into two equal pieces, (<math>L_0</math>, <math>R_0</math>)For each round <math>i =0,1,dots,n</math>, computewhere <math>T_i = mathrm F(L_i' - R_i', K_i)</math> and <math>(L_0',R_0') = mathrm H(L_0,R_0)</math>Then the ciphertext is <math>(L_{n+1}, R_{n+1}) = (L_{n+1}',R_{n+1}')</math>.Decryption of a ciphertext <math>(L_{n+1}, R_{n+1})</math> is accomplished by computing for <math>i=n,n-1,ldots,0</math>where <math>T_i = mathrm F(L_{i+1}' - R_{i+1}',K_i)</math> and <math>(L_{n+1}',R_{n+1}')=mathrm H^{-1}(L_{n+1},R_{n+1})</math>Then <math>(L_0,R_0) = (L_0',R_0')</math> is the plaintext again.Many modern block ciphers and hashes are ARX algorithmsxe2x80x94their round function involves only three operations: modular addition, rotation with fixed rotation amounts, and XOR (ARX).The two halves are then swapped.Let <math>{rm F}</math> be the round function and letThen the basic operation is as follows:Split the plaintext block into two equal pieces, (<math>L_0</math>, <math>R_0</math>)For each round <math>i =0,1,dots,n</math>, computeThen the ciphertext is <math>(R_{n+1}, L_{n+1})</math>.Decryption of a ciphertext <math>(R_{n+1}, L_{n+1})</math> is accomplished by computing for <math>i=n,n-1,ldots,0</math>Then <math>(L_0,R_0)</math> is the plaintext again.One advantage of the Feistel model compared to a substitutionxe2x80x93permutation network is that the round function <math>{rm F}</math> does not have to be invertible.The Laixe2x80x93Massey scheme offers security properties similar to those of the Feistel structure.there is a palette of attack techniques against which a block cipher must be secure, in addition to being robust against brute-force attacks.Most block cipher algorithms are classified as iterated block ciphers which means that they transform fixed-size blocks of plaintext into identically sized blocks of ciphertext, via the repeated application of an invertible transformation known as the round function, with each iteration referred to as a round.where <math>M_0</math> is the plaintext and <math>M_r</math> the ciphertext, with r being the number of rounds.Frequently, key whitening is used in addition to this.Each corresponds to a mathematical model that can be used to prove properties of higher level algorithms, such as CBC.This general approach to cryptography xe2x80x93 proving higher-level algorithms (such as CBC) are secure under explicitly stated assumptions regarding their components (such as a block cipher) xe2x80x93 is known as provable security.Informally, a block cipher is secure in the standard model if an attacker cannot tell the difference between the block cipher (equipped with a random key) and a random permutation.To be a bit more precise, let E be an n-bit block cipher.The S-boxes are the S.One important type of iterated block cipher known as a substitutionxe2x80x93permutation network (SPN) takes a block of the plaintext and the key as inputs, and applies several alternating rounds consisting of a substitution stage followed by a permutation stagexe2x80x94to produce each block of ciphertext output.A substitution box (S-box) substitutes a small block of input bits with another block of output bits.The rotational cryptanalysis technique attempts to attack such round functions.Other operations often used in block ciphers includedata-dependent rotations as in RC5 and RC6,a substitution box implemented as a lookup table as in Data Encryption Standard and Advanced Encryption Standard,a permutation box,and multiplication as in IDEA.A block cipher by itself allows encryption only of a single data block of the cipher's block length. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Captain Jean-Franxc3xa7ois-Timothxc3xa9e Trullet of Guerrier shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on Zealous.The third British ship into action was HMS Orion under Captain Sir James Saumarez, which rounded the engagement at the head of the battle line and passed between the French main line and the frigates that lay closer inshore.The next three British ships, Vanguard in the lead followed by HMS Minotaur and HMS Defence, remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40.The French suffered too, Admiral Brueys on Orient was severely wounded in the face and hand by flying debris during the opening exchange of fire with Bellerophon.At 19:00 the identifying lights in the mizzenmasts of the British fleet were lit.The legend of the battle has remained prominent in the popular consciousness, with perhaps the best-known representation being Felicia Hemans' 1826 poem Casabianca.Napoleon Bonaparte's victories in northern Italy over the Austrian Empire helped secure victory for the French in the War of the First Coalition in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still at war with the French Republic.Bonaparte believed that, by establishing a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral Ottoman Empire), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against British India, possibly by means of an alliance with the Tipu Sultan of Seringapatam, that might successfully drive the British out of the war.Bonaparte's armada sailed from Toulon on 19 May, making rapid progress through the Ligurian Sea and collecting more ships at Genoa, before sailing southwards along the Sardinian coast and passing Sicily on 7 June.While Bonaparte was sailing to Malta, the Royal Navy re-entered the Mediterranean for the first time in more than a year.At 14:00 on 1 August, lookouts on HMS Zealous reported the French anchored in Aboukir Bay, its signal lieutenant just beating the lieutenant on HMS Goliath with the signal, but inaccurately describing 16 French ships of the line instead of 13.As his ships readied for action, Brueys ordered his captains to gather for a conference on Orient and hastily recalled his shore parties, although most had still not returned by the start of the battle.Nelson ordered the fleet to slow down at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig "springs" on their anchor cables, a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their broadsides to face an enemy while stationary.Writing many years later, Bonaparte commented that if the French Navy had adopted the same tactical principles as the British:By contrast, the British press were jubilant; many newspapers sought to portray the battle as a victory for Britain over anarchy, and the success was used to attack the supposedly pro-republican Whig politicians Charles James Fox and Richard Brinsley Sheridan.There has been extensive historiographical debate over the comparative strengths of the fleets, although they were ostensibly evenly matched in size, each containing 13 ships of the line.The Battle of the Nile has been called "arguably, the most decisive  naval engagement of the great age of sail",The Ottomans, with whom Bonaparte had hoped to conduct an alliance once his control of Egypt was complete, were encouraged by the Battle of the Nile to go to war against France.In spite of the overwhelming British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Talking about Herigar, the prefect of Birka:Herigar's church was not far from the place where tings were held:Another church was also built in Sweden, however location is left open:The exiled Swedish King Anund Uppsale confirms that either one of the churches was in Birka itself when he ponders if Birka should be plundered:Danes attacked Birka, accompanied with the deposed king Anund, which caused great distress in the town.As the neighbouring "city" is not mentioned in any other context than during the Danish attack as a place where people took refuge, it probably meant a nearby fortress.Adam himself never visited Birka.Adam described Birka as a Geatish port town and had gathered many details about it.Having described Vxc3xa4stergxc3xb6tland and Skara, Adam writes:Noteworthy in the following statement is the usage of the term "not far" (non longe) which was also used to describe the distance between Birka and the Uppsala temple:Adam also had travel instructions from Skxc3xa5ne to Sigtuna:"Telgas" is not mentioned anywhere else, and it remains as speculative as Birka.When Ansgar again travelled to Birka from Germany about 852, it went easier:This might mean that he sailed off from Hamburg or Bremen instead of some port in Baltic Sea, since the later account by Adam of Bremen gives the distance of Scania and Birka to be only five days at sea.Several Swedish kings of the 9th century, Bjxc3xb6rn, Anund and Olof, are all mentioned in Vita to have spent time in Birka. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Carbapenems are resistant to ESBL-mediated hydrolysis and exhibit excellent in vitro activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae expressing ESBLs.Strains producing only ESBLs are susceptible to cephamycins and carbapenems in vitro and show little if any inoculum effect with these agents.For organisms producing TEM and SHV type ESBLs, apparent in vitro sensitivity to cefepime and to piperacillin/tazobactam is common, but both drugs show an inoculum effect, with diminished susceptibility as the size of the inoculum is increased from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> organisms.Strains with some CTX-Mxe2x80x93type and OXA-type ESBLs are resistant to cefepime on testing, despite the use of a standard inoculum.Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by clavulanic acid and sulbactam, thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactamxe2x80x94beta lactamase inhibitor combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanate (Co-amoxiclav), ticarcillin-clavulanate, and ampicillin/sulbactam, they remain susceptible to inhibition by tazobactam and subsequently the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam.AmpC-producing strains are typically resistant to oxyimino-beta lactams and to cephamycins and are susceptible to carbapenems; however, diminished porin expression can make such a strain carbapenem-resistant as well.Strains with IMP-, VIM-, and OXA-type carbapenemases usually remain susceptible.E. coli bacteria on the left are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, and grow next to one antibiotic (bottom) and are less inhibited by another antibiotic (top).Beta-lactamases are enzymes () produced by bacteria that provide multi- resistance to xcexb2-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, cephamycins, and carbapenems (ertapenem), although carbapenems are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase.Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.Other plasmid-mediated ESBLs, such as PER, VEB, GES, and IBC beta-lactamases, have been described but are uncommon and have been found mainly in P. aeruginosa and at a limited number of geographic sites. </my-abstract>

<my-abstract> Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8., there were 438 Boeing 747s in airline service, with Atlas Air (41) as the largest operator and Lufthansa (27) being the largest passenger operator.The last US passenger Boeing 747 was retired from Delta Air Lines in December 2017, after it flew for every American major carrier since its 1970 introduction., a small subset of those which were intended to be parted-out get $3 million D-checks before flying again.Young -400s are sold for 320 million yuan ($50 million) and Boeing stopped converting freighters, which used to cost nearly $30 million.This comeback helped the airframer financing arm Boeing Capital to shrink its exposure to the 747-8 from $1.07 billion in 2017 to $481 million in 2018.In July 2020, British Airways announced that it was retiring its 747 fleet.Boeing 747 orders and deliveries (cumulative, by year):<br

attributed to design flaws of the 747.The new 747-8 freighters will replace AirBridgeCargo's current 747-400 aircraft and expand the airline's fleet and will be acquired through a mix of direct purchases and leasing over the next six years, Boeing said.On July 27, 2016, in its quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft.On July 2, 2020, it was reported that Boeing planned to end 747 production in 2022 upon delivery of the remaining jets on order to UPS and the Volga-Dnepr Group due to low demand.The aircraft was to carry 295 passengers a range of .As Airbus progressed with its A3XX study, Boeing offered a 747 derivative as an alternative in 2000; a more modest proposal than the previous -500X and -600X that retained the 747's overall wing design and add a segment at the root, increasing the span to .Like its predecessor, the 747X family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the Sonic Cruiser concept.After the end of the 747X program, Boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747.b'      DESCRIPTION:  American wide-body longxe2x80x93range commercial jet aircraft.{|{ }{ }The Boeing 747 is a large, longxe2x80x93range wide-body airliner and cargo aircraft manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the United States.After introducing the 707 in October 1958, Pan Am wanted a jet 2xc2xbd times its size, to reduce its seat cost by 30% to democratize air travel.Passenger, short range and combination freighter-passenger versions of the 300 series were produced.In 1985, development of the longer range 747-400 began.In 1991, a record-breaking 1,087 passengers were airlifted aboard a 747 to Israel as part of Operation Solomon.On November 14, 2005, Boeing announced it was launching the 747 Advanced as the Boeing 747-8.In January 2016, Boeing stated it was reducing 747-8 production to six a year beginning in September 2016, incurring a $569 million post-tax charge against its fourth-quarter 2015 profits.During the ceremonial 747 contract-signing banquet in Seattle on Boeing's 50th Anniversary, Juan Trippe predicted that the 747 would be "xe2x80xa6a great weapon for peace, competing with intercontinental missiles for mankind's destiny".Ultimately, the high-winged CX-HLS Boeing design was not used for the 747, although technologies developed for their bid had an influence.One of the principal technologies that enabled an aircraft as large as the 747 to be drawn up was the high-bypass turbofan engine.All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area; Douglas had a small "pod" just forward and above the wing, Lockheed used a long "spine" running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it, while Boeing blended the two, with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing.The 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s.In 1965, Joe Sutter was transferred from Boeing's 737 development team to manage the design studies for the new airliner, already assigned the model number 747.When economic problems in the US and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic, several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically, and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijet wide bodiesAfter the initial , Boeing developed the , a higher maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) variant, and the  (Short Range), with higher passenger capacity.The 747 line was further developed with the launch of the  on June 11, 1980, followed by interest from Swissair a month later and the go-ahead for the project.

<my-abstract> Keegan also speculated that due to the relatively low number of archers actually involved in killing the French knights (roughly 200 by his estimate), together with the refusal of the English knights to assist in a duty they saw as distastefully unchivalrous, and combined with the sheer difficulty of killing such a large number of prisoners in such a short space of time, the actual number of French prisoners put to death may not have been substantial before the French reserves fled the field and Henry rescinded the order.The French had suffered a catastrophic defeat.The unexpected English victory against the numerically superior French army boosted English morale and prestige, crippled France and started a new period of English dominance in the war.After several decades of relative peace, the English had resumed the war in 1415 amid the failure of negotiations with the French.The French had originally drawn up a battle plan that had archers and crossbowmen in front of their men-at-arms, with a cavalry force at the rear specifically designed to "fall upon the archers, and use their force to break them," but in the event, the French archers and crossbowmen were deployed behind and to the sides of the men-at-arms (where they seem to have played almost no part, except possibly for an initial volley of arrows at the start of the battle).Curry and Mortimer questioned the reliability of the Gesta, as there have been doubts as to how much it was written as propaganda for Henry V. Both note that the Gesta vastly overestimates the number of French in the battle; its proportions of English archers to men-at-arms at the battle are also different from those of the English army before the siege of Harfleur. </my-abstract>

<title>Bronze Age</title>
<wiki-abstract> The Bronze Age is a historical period that was characterized by the use of bronze, in some areas proto-writing, and other early features of urban civilization. The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system, as proposed in modern times by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, for classifying and studying ancient societies. </wiki-abstract>
